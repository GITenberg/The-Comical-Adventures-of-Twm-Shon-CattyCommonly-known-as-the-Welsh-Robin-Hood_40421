<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>In presenting to the public the following Enlarged and
Corrected Edition of &ldquo;Twm Shon Catty,&rdquo; the author
cannot forget that on its first appearance in 1836, with
&ldquo;all its imperfections on its head,&rdquo; it was received
with a welcome quite unlooked for on the part of the writer, and
he now presents this edition to the world, with several additions
and alterations.</p>
<p>On examining the cause of such unlooked-for approbation, he
found it, not in any merit of his own, but in the nationality of
his subject, and the humiliating suggestion that, slight as it
was, it was the first attempted thing that could bear the title
of a Welsh Novel.</p>
<p>It is true others have made Wales the scene of action for the
heroes of their Tales; but however talented such writers might
be, to the Welshman&rsquo;s feelings they lacked nationality, and
betrayed the hand of the foreigner in the working of the web; its
texture perchance, filled up with yams of finer fleeces, but
strange and loveless to their unaccustomed eyes.</p>
<p>Were a native of one of the South Sea Islands to publish the
life and adventures of one of their legendary heroes, it is
probable that such a production would excite more attention, as a
true transcript of mind and manners of the people he essayed to
describe, than the more polished pages of the courtly English and
French novelist, who undertook to write on the same
subject.&nbsp; On the same principle, the author of this
unpretending little provincial production accounts for the sunny
gleams of favour that have flashed on the new tract which he has
endeavoured to tread down, among briers and brambles of an
unexplored way, while the smoother path of the practised
traveller has been shrouded in gloom.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>The
expression of the Author&rsquo;s gratitude is here presented to
the Rev. W. J. Rees, Rector of Cascob, for numerous favours; and
especially for the historic and traditional matter that his
researches furnished.&nbsp; To the Critics of the Cambrian
Quarterly for their favourable notice of the &ldquo;Small
Book,&rdquo; a skeleton as it then was, compared to the present
Edition, imperfect as it still remains.&nbsp; And lastly to the
revered memory of the late Archdeacon Benyon of Llandilo.&nbsp;
That lamented friend of Wales and Welshmen, (whose aims were ever
directed to the enlargement of the narrow boundary within which
prejudice and custom had encircled and enchained Welsh
literature,) in the town-hall of Carmarthen, before his highly
respectable Auditors, honoured this production with a favourable
notice.&nbsp; He warmly eulogised the Author&rsquo;s attempt at
the production of the first Welsh Novel; and concluded by an
offer of a pecuniary reward to the person who could give the best
translation of it in the best Welsh language.</p>
<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">The</span> name of Twm
Shon Catty, popular throughout Wales.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Inn-Keeper&rsquo;s Album,&rdquo; and the drama founded
thereon.&nbsp; Twm Shon Catty apparently born in different
towns.&nbsp; A correct account of his birth and parentage.</p>
<p>It is often the custom, however foolish it may be, to frighten
the occupants of an English nursery into submission by saying,
&ldquo;The bogie is coming,&rdquo; and though the exact form or
attributes of the said &ldquo;bogie&rdquo; are by no means
definitely known, the mere mention of the individual has
sufficient power to make the juveniles cover their heads, and
dive under the bed-clothes, with fear.&nbsp; The preface to the
once popular farce of &ldquo;Killing no Murder&rdquo; informs us,
that many a fry of infant Methodists are terrified and frightened
to bed by the cry of &ldquo;the Bishop is
coming!&rdquo;&mdash;That the right reverend prelates of the
realm should become bugbears and buggaboos to frighten the
children of Dissenters, is curious enough, and evinces a
considerable degree of ingenious <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>malignity in bringing Episcopacy into
contempt, if true.&nbsp; Be that as it may in England, in Wales
it is not so; for the demon of terror and monster of the nursery
there, to check the shrill cry of infancy, and enforce silent
obedience to the nurse or mother is Twm Shon Catty.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;babes and sucklings&rdquo; are not the only ones on
whom that name has continued to act as a spell; nor for fear and
wonder its only attributes, for the knavish exploits and comic
feats of Twm Shon Catty are, like those of Robin Hood in England,
the themes of many a rural rhyme, and the subject of many a
village tale; where, seated round the ample hearth of a farm
house, or the more limited one of a lowly cottage, an attentive
audience is ever found, where his mirth-exciting tricks are told
and listened to with vast satisfaction, unsated by the frequency
of repetition; for the &ldquo;lowly train&rdquo; are generally
strangers to that fastidiousness which turns disgusted, from a
twice-told tale.</p>
<p>Although neither the legends, the poetry, nor the history of
the principality, seem to interest, or accord with the taste of
our English brethren, the name of Twm Shon Catty, curiously
enough, not only made its way among them, but had the unexpected
honour of being woven into a tale, and exhibited on the stage, as
a Welsh national dramatic spectacle, under the title, and the
imposing second title, of Twn <i>John</i> Catty, or, the Welsh
Rob Roy.&nbsp; The nationality of the Welsh residents in London,
who always bear their country along with them wherever they go,
was immediately roused, notwithstanding the great offence of
substituting &ldquo;John&rdquo; for &ldquo;Shon,&rdquo; which
called at once on their curiosity and love of country to pursue
the &ldquo;Inkeeper&rsquo;s Album,&rdquo; in which this tale
first appeared, and to visit the Cobourg Theatre, where
overflowing houses nightly attended the representation of the
&ldquo;Welsh Rob Roy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this second title, which
confounded the poor Cambrians, was a grand expedient of the
Dramatist, to excite the attention <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>of the Londoners, who naturally
associated it with the hero of the celebrated Scotch novel.&nbsp;
The bait was immediately swallowed, and that tale, an awkward and
most weak attempt to imitate the &ldquo;Great Unknown,&rdquo; and
by far the worst article in a very clever book, actually sold the
volume.</p>
<p>As Twm Shon Catty was invariably known to every Crymrian as a
great practical joker, they were of course proportionately
surprised to find him manufactured into a stilted, injured,
melo-dramatic chieftain, for the love of his <i>Ellen</i>, dying
the death of a hero!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may do for London, but in Wales, where
&lsquo;<i>Gwir yn erbyn y byd</i>&rsquo; <a
name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a> is our motto, we know better!&rdquo;
muttered many a testy Cambrian, which he felt doubly indignant at
the authors&rsquo; and actors&rsquo; errors in the mis-writing
and the mis-pronouncing the well-known &ldquo;sponsorial or
baptismal appellation,&rdquo; <a name="citation9b"></a><a
href="#footnote9b" class="citation">[9b]</a> as Doctor Pangloss
would say: and another source of umbrage to them was, that an
English author&rsquo;s sacrilegiously dignifying Twm with the
qualities of a hero, conveying the villanous inference that Wales
was barren of <i>real</i> heroes&mdash;an insinuation that no
Welshman could tamely endure to forgive.&nbsp; In an instant
recurred the honoured names of Rodri Mawr, Owen Gwyneth,
Caswallon ab Beli, Own Glyndwr, Rhys ab Thomas, and a vast chain
of Cambrian worthies, not forgetting the royal race of Tudor,
that gave an Elizabeth to the English throne; on which the mimic
scene before them, and the high vauntings of Huntley in the
character of Twm Shon Catty, sunk into the insignificance of a
punch and puppet show, in comparison with the mighty men who then
passed before the mental eye.</p>
<p>Sir John Wynn, of Gwydir, bart., was the father of our hero,
who was a natural son by a woman called Catherine.&nbsp; Little
or nothing is known of her, but <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>surnames not being generally adopted
in Wales, her son, by Universal consent, was called &ldquo;Twn
Shon Catty,&rdquo; which means literally, &ldquo;Thoms John
Catherine.&rdquo;&nbsp; One very astute English Commentator
informs us that the name &ldquo;Catty&rdquo; originated in the
fact that of his armorial bearings included a Cat&rsquo;s
Eye!!&nbsp; This is simply nonsense, as every Welshman can
testify.</p>
<p>Like the immortal Homer, different towns have put forth their
claims to the enviable distinction of having given our hero
birth; among which Cardigan, Llandovery, and Carmarthen, are said
to have displayed considerable warmth in asserting their
respective pretentions.&nbsp; A native of the latter far-famed
borough town, whose carbuncled face and rubicund
nose&mdash;indelible stamps of bacchanalian
royalty&mdash;proclaimed him the undisputed prince of topers,
roundly affirmed that no town but Carmarthen&mdash;ever famed for
its stout ale, large dampers, <a name="citation10"></a><a
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a> and blustering
heroes of the pipe and pot&mdash;could possibly have produced
such a jolly dog.&nbsp; It is with regret that we perceive such
potent authority opposed by the united opinions of our Cambrian
bards and antiquaries, who place his birth in the year 1570, at
Tregaron, that primitive, yet no longer obscure, Cardiganshire
town, but long celebrated throughout the principality for its
pony fair; and above all, as the established birthplace of Twm
Shon Catty.</p>
<p>He first saw the light, it seems, at a house of his
mother&rsquo;s, situate on a hill south-east of Tregaron, called
Llidiard-y-Fynnon, (Fountain-Gate,) from its situation beside an
excellent well, that previous to the discovery of other springs
nearer to their habitations, supplied the good people of Tregaron
with water.&nbsp; That distinguished spot is now, however, more
generally known by the more elevated name of Pl&acirc;s Twm Shon
Catty, (the mansion of Twm Shon Catty,) the ruins of which are
now pointed out by the neighbouring <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>people to any curious traveller who
may wish to enrich the pages of his virgin tour by their
important communications.</p>
<p>And now, having given our hero&rsquo;s birth and parentage
with the fidelity of a true historian, who has a most virtuous
scorn of the spurious embellishments of fiction, a more excursive
pen shall flourish on our future chapters.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">The</span> grandfather of
Twm Shon Catty.&nbsp; Squire Graspacre on morality.&nbsp; Sir
Jno. Wynn, the practical exponent of it&mdash;and our hero the
result thereof.</p>
<p>Catty, the mother of Twm, lived in the most unsophisticated
manner at Llidiard-y-Fynnon, with an ill-favoured, hump-backed
sister, who was the general drudge and domestic manager.&nbsp;
Their mother had long been dead, and their father, the horned
cattle, a small farm and all its appurtenances, had been lost to
them about two years.&nbsp; This little farm was their
father&rsquo;s property, but provokingly situated in the middle
of the vast possessions of Squire Graspacre, an English
gentleman-farmer, who condescendingly fixed himself in the
principality with the laudable idea of civilizing the Welsh.</p>
<p>The most feasible mode of accomplishing so grand an
undertaking, that appeared to him, was, to dispossess them of
their property, and to take as much as possible of their country
into his own paternal care.&nbsp; The rude Welsh, to be sure, he
found so blind to their own interests as to prefer living on
their farms to either selling or giving them away, to profit by
his superior management.&nbsp; His master-genius now became
apparent to everybody; for after ruining the owners, and
appropriating to himself half the neighbouring country, the other
half became his own with <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>ease, as the poor little freeholders
found it better to accept a small sum for their property, than to
have all wasted in litigation, and perhaps, ultimately, to end
their days in prison.</p>
<p>The maternal grandfather of Twm Shon Catty, was the last who
held out against the tyranny of the squire.&nbsp; He triumphantly
won his cause; but because he could not pay the costs, he was
imprisoned by his own solicitor, in the county gaol of Cardigan,
where it is said he died of a broken heart.&nbsp; The squire then
gained his ends.&nbsp; The farm-house (separated from the land,
which was added to another farm) became the dwelling of the old
farmer&rsquo;s two daughters: not a gift, as they had to pay
annually about twice as much rental as they ought to have
paid.</p>
<p>It was soon after this admirable settlement of his affairs,
that the squire had a grand visitor to entertain at Graspacre
Hall, who was no less a personage than Sir John Wynn, of Gwydir,
in North Wales, whose sister our deep-scheming squire had just
married, with the politic view of identifying himself with the
Cambrian principality, and becoming one of the landed proprietors
of the country.&nbsp; One day, after a long ride with his noble
guest, over his far-spreading hills and vales, it was poor
Catty&rsquo;s lot to be observed by these lordly sons of
affluence.&nbsp; She was spinning wool at the cottage door, a
work which she seldom performed without the accompaniment of a
song; and at that time she was giving utterance to a mournful
ditty, as the recent death of her father had naturally attuned
her mind to melancholy, and cast a cloud over her usual
cheerfulness.</p>
<p>The great men stopped their horses: &ldquo;a fine girl, Sir
John,&rdquo; cried the squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right!&rdquo; said the baronet: &ldquo;I wonder
if she would object to a few delicate attentions from a man of
honour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Object! my dear sir, I am surprised that you should ask
the question.&nbsp; The girl is poor and <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>friendless,
and has just buried her father.&nbsp; My dear sir, it would be
kind of you, if you were to call and offer her those
&lsquo;delicate attentions&rsquo; of which you speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amorous baronet was not slow to avail himself of this very
amiable suggestion, delivered with a significant leer which could
not be mistaken; he called for several successive evenings at
Llidiard-y-Fynnon; but we may very reasonably question the
<i>delicacy</i> of the attentions he proffered to the fair
Catty.&nbsp; The sequel to the adventure soon became notorious,
and the maiden Catty became the mother of our redoubted hero,
thence, with an illusion to his father, called Twm Shon
Catty.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">The</span> boy indicative
of the man.&nbsp; Antiquarian propensities show themselves.&nbsp;
His mother rises in the world, and assumes the dignified office
of village schoolmistress.&nbsp; Her mode of tuition.&nbsp; Twm a
member of the &ldquo;academy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the period of early infancy seldom contains incidents
worthy the recording pen of history, we shall bring our hero at
once at his fourth year.&nbsp; The biographers of great men have
generally evinced a predilection to present their readers with
certain early indications of the peculiar genius that has
distinguished their heroes in after life; and far from us be the
presumption of deviating from such a popular and legitimate rule,
by any radical attempt at innovation or improvement.</p>
<p>Pope&rsquo;s lispings in numbers, West&rsquo;s quaker
daublings in childhood, with many other instances, not forgetting
Peter Pindar&rsquo;s waggery on Sir Joseph Bank&rsquo;s spreading
spiders and butterflies on his bread and butter, <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>(certain
indication of the future Naturalist,) are cases in point, which
are familiar to every reader; true or not, we have also heard the
story of Sir Isaac Newton&rsquo;s partiality for apples, in
childhood; that Paganini&rsquo;s first desire was for a sixpenny
toy fiddle; that other great men in infancy exemplified the motto
that &ldquo;Coming events cast their shadows before them;&rdquo;
and it will not appear strange to those already acquainted with
his fame, that we have to add to these eminent names that of our
long neglected hero.</p>
<p>It is true he became neither a poet, a painter, nor a natural
historian, but, according to the unbiassed opinions of geniuses
of the same caste with himself, who could not be suspected of
either egotism or partiality, a superior character to
either&mdash;an eminent antiquary&mdash;to which may be added,
though perhaps it ought to take the lead&mdash;a no less eminent
thief&mdash;if thief he can be called whose illicit doings were
prompted by no motives of selfishness, but were ever the
spontaneous offspring of whim and madcap daring.</p>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s mother affirms (and when a lady affirms anything
the gentlemen feel bound to believe in, and swear by it,) that
her son&rsquo;s first predilection consisted of an intense
affection for street rubbish.&nbsp; The gutters and sweepings of
Tregaron furnished him with materials for an antiquarian
exhibition which he held in a stable manger.&nbsp; The pottery of
bygone days, somewhat the worse for wear and tear, but still
exhibiting the taste and substantial ideas of the original
manufactures&mdash;cutlery of Sheffield manufactures, discarded
and useless, but not beneath the notice of our juvenile
showman&mdash;twisted hemp and bits of figured rags and paper,
relics of time past&mdash;all formed part and parcel of his
&ldquo;exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be sure his occupation was not of the cleanest.&nbsp; To
secure these priceless relics, he coated hands, face, and
clothes, with a thick crust of mud, and thus showed his origin,
by the close affection he had for mother earth.&nbsp; As in these
little fancies he spent the <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>greater part of his time, it became a
wonder to his mother that he seldom ran home for food; but it was
soon discovered that he had a mode peculiar to himself of raising
contributions on the public of which he was a member, by forcing
them to part with a portion of their bread and butter&mdash;a
praiseworthy act, and trebly commendable, as in the first place
it showed his filial piety, in saving his mother the expense of
his victuals; in the next, it taught courtesy to the churlish,
who in time anticipated his demand by voluntary offerings; and
thirdly, it engendered the principle of honesty in their tender
minds, by marking the propriety of paying for their curiosity in
gaping over the produce of his labours.&nbsp; This, it will also
be observed, was another feature that announced his future
character, which, it will be seen, &ldquo;grew with his growth,
and strengthened with his strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Jno. Wynn was made acquainted with the result of those
&ldquo;delicate attentions,&rdquo; to which we have before
alluded, and as some sort of compensation, he bought the cottage
of Squire Graspacre, and presented it to Catty, as the reward of
her kind compliance with his &ldquo;delicate&rdquo; wishes.&nbsp;
The little property made her of great importance in the
district.&nbsp; As the house was large, and not overstocked with
inhabitants, it occurred to the good people of Tregaron, that a
day-school might be established within its walls; and having with
their own consent found a school-room, by the same indisputable
right they fixed on Catty for its mistress, and instituted her
governess, to rule their tender progeny.</p>
<p>Catty, with huge grin of approbation at her unexpected
promotion, immediately ratified their election, and declared both
her house and self ready for the reception of pupils at the
moderate terms of a penny a week.&nbsp; Her hump-backed sister
was by no means pleased with this arrangement, and very testily
asked, &ldquo;Who was to clean up the house after the grubby
fry?&rdquo;&nbsp; Catty made no reply, but in the pride of her
heart hummed a gay song, scratched the mud off her <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>boy&rsquo;s
clothes with an old birch broom, which being hardened by sweeping
the house, answered the purpose better than a brush, and had some
old coffers converted into benches for the service of her
scholars.</p>
<p>She then with singular alacrity, proceeded to cut from the
hedge, with her own fair hand, one of the most engaging-looking
birch rods, that ever was wielded by rural governess.&nbsp; This
premature display of the sceptre of severity was far from
fortunate, and nearly ruined the undertaking at the outset.&nbsp;
The tender mothers of Tregaron were startled at so unexpected a
proceeding, and practically declared they had rather their dear
babes should be brought up like calves and pigs, in the most
bestial ignorance, than have knowledge beaten into them at the
nether end with a birch rod.</p>
<p>Catty immediately quieted their fears, by protesting that she
entertained the utmost abhorrence of the flagellation system, and
that the bunch of birch was but bound together for a very
different purpose, namely, to be suspended as a sign over her
door.&nbsp; As Catty was all compliance with their requisitions,
every thing was set to rights; and without more ado children were
sent from every house where the affluence of the inmates enabled
them to give their offspring the first rudiments of
education.&nbsp; The mother of Twm became the pink and paragon of
schoolmistresses.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, the noise and uproar of
her school was so great, that the pigs were frightened from their
trough, and the curate&rsquo;s wife, who rode an ill-tamed horse,
was thrown headlong into the well, when passing the academy, from
the animal taking fright; but that was no fault of Catty&rsquo;s;
people should break in their horses properly, and curates&rsquo;
wives should learn to ride and keep their seats better.&nbsp;
Besides, the alleged uproar was the greatest evidence in her
favour, as it proved the tenderness of her heart in not
correcting her scholars&mdash;a quality more valued by their
maternal parents than any other that could be substituted; and in
their appreciation of this prime <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>desideratum, they omitted to inquire
minutely into her other qualifications for a governess.</p>
<p>Unreasonable people might have asserted that she should at
least have been able to read and write with ordinary
ability.&nbsp; But poor Catty was not troubled with either of
these accomplishments, and believed with Dogberry, that
&ldquo;reading and writing came by nature,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;where ignorance is bliss, &rsquo;twere folly to be
wise.&rdquo;&nbsp; She congratulated herself that none could say
to her &ldquo;Too much learning hath made thee mad;&rdquo; and
inwardly thanked heaven that her sanity would be unquestioned if
such a test was applied to her.</p>
<p>Many of Catty&rsquo;s pupils had been taken by their wise and
considerate mothers out of the curate&rsquo;s school, fearful
that his severity would break their hearts; and having there
learnt their letters and a little spelling, they kept possession
at least of what they had acquired, by teaching other children,
which flattered their childish vanity, while it served their
mistress, who, like a sage general that stands aloof from the
broil of battle, takes to herself the credit of success, while
the real operators are forgotten.&nbsp; Thus in time, with the
powerful support of the matrons of Tregaron, who took the lead of
their spouses, and directed the taste and opinions of the
clodhopping community, Catty&rsquo;s school became an alarming
rival to the curate&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The mode of tuition adopted by Twm&rsquo;s mother, was an
entirely original one, as the reader will have surmised.&nbsp; It
cost very little trouble in acquiring, because its chief secret
consisted in tutor and pupils doing just what they chose.&nbsp;
It may save a good deal of anxiety and trouble to those tutors
who are too conscientious if we furnish them with a leaf from the
book of this original preceptor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, little Guenny Cadwgan,&rdquo; said Catty one
day, &ldquo;Come here, my little pretty buttercup, and say your
lesson, if you can; but if you can&rsquo;t, never mind, I
won&rsquo;t beat nor scold you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Guenny came forward
bobbing a curtsey, and while his mistress <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>broomed the
mud from little Twm&rsquo;s breeches, began her lesson.</p>
<p><i>Guenny</i>.&mdash;a, b, hab.</p>
<p><i>Catty</i>.&mdash;There&rsquo;s a good maaid!</p>
<p><i>Guenny</i>.&mdash;e, b, heb.</p>
<p><i>Catty</i>.&mdash;There&rsquo;s a good maaid!</p>
<p><i>Guenny</i>.&mdash;o, b, hob.</p>
<p><i>Catty</i>.&mdash;There&rsquo;s a good maaid!</p>
<p><i>Guenny</i>.&mdash;i, b,&mdash;can&rsquo;t tell.</p>
<p><i>Catty</i>.&mdash;Skipe it, child, skipe it&mdash;(meaning
&ldquo;skip it.&rdquo;)</p>
<p><i>Guenny</i>.&mdash;u, b, cub.</p>
<p><i>Catty</i>.&mdash;There&rsquo;s a good maaid!&nbsp; Twm you
little wicked dog, don&rsquo;t kick the child.&nbsp; Go on,
Guenny vach.</p>
<p><i>Twm</i>.&mdash;(who had been struggling for some time to
get from under his mother&rsquo;s combs,) I want to go a
fishing.</p>
<p><i>Catty</i>.&mdash;Lord love the darling child!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll fall into the river and be drowned.</p>
<p><i>Twm</i>.&mdash;Oh! no, mother; I always fish in the
gutters.</p>
<p><i>Dio Bengoch</i>.&mdash;I want to go home for some bread and
butter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I! and I! and I!&rdquo; squalls every urchin in the
school; and out they would run in a drove, on perceiving the
independent exit of master Twm, without waiting for the
permission of his parent and governess.</p>
<h2><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A <span class="smcap">lecture</span> on
learning.&nbsp; Astuteness below stairs.&nbsp; A
gentleman&rsquo;s opinion on servants.&nbsp; A horse
milliner.&nbsp; Intimacy with Catty.&nbsp; More suspicion of
&ldquo;delicate attentions,&rdquo; which so far are not quite so
criminal as the squire&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Perhaps our modern governesses who possess the vain
accomplishment of reading and writing, may feel disposed to
undervalue the acquirements of our rural Welsh governess.&nbsp;
But let them not triumph; and be it recollected that tastes
differ, and that many of our living patricians, as well as
wealthy plebeians, who are considered the great, the mighty, and
the respectable of the land, deprecate with becoming vehemence
the prevailing mania for educating the poor.&nbsp; We have heard
ladies, and great ones too, attired in silks and velvets, pall
and purple, and &ldquo;faring sumptuously every day,&rdquo;
declare most positively that they never knew a servant good for
anything that could read and write.</p>
<p>No sooner were they capable of wielding a goose quill, than
the impudent hussies presumed to have a will of their own, and
their opinions mounted a step nearer to the attitude of their
mistresses.&nbsp; And on men, they said, education had a worse
effect, as thereby they became the idle readers of books and
newspapers, which made them saucy to their superiors, and
sometimes the most villanous cut-throat radicals.&nbsp; Now it
will be readily admitted, we should think, that there was little
danger of Catty&rsquo;s scholars ever becoming such pernicious
characters; and therefore, let not liberal envy withhold from her
the well-merited meed of applause.&nbsp; Alas for the good old
times&mdash;we see no such school-mistresses now-a-days! those
days of the golden age of simplicity are gone for ever.</p>
<p>Perhaps we might wonder that the parents of the children,
those who paid such a round sum every <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>week for instruction administered to
those &ldquo;babes and sucklings,&rdquo; did not grumble at the
slow pace at which the process went on.&nbsp; But to criticise a
subject properly, we must be &ldquo;well up&rdquo; in it, and the
villagers of Tregaron were not exactly calculated to measure the
amount of &ldquo;book larning&rdquo; their babes did, or did not
acquire.&nbsp; They were satisfied if their children were
&ldquo;out of the way, the livelong day&rdquo; and a penny per
week was surely not so high a price to pay for that luxury.</p>
<p>Although our hero&rsquo;s mother could not be called a woman
of letters, she certainly possessed qualities more original than
generally fell to the lot of persons in her station.&nbsp; At
carding wool or spinning it, knitting stockings or mittens, the
most envious admitted her superiority to every woman in
Tregaron.</p>
<p>She moreover had gained no small consideration in another
character, which her jealous neighbours satirically denominated a
hedge milliner, whose province it was to mend hedging gloves and
coarse frocks for ploughmen, to darn or patch with leather the
heels of their stout woollen stockings, and also to repair horse
collars at half the price charged by old Daff the saddler; the
latter part of her occupation, which required a delicate hand to
cut the slender sewing thongs from the raw bull hides, caused her
to be called a horse milliner, which, after all, was not much
more applicable than if she had been called a bull tailor.&nbsp;
This malignant waggery, however, was unable to disturb the
tranquil soul of Catty; she loved horses, and in her juvenile
days had often whiled away her mornings and evenings in the rural
pastime of driving them, both in plough and harrow, while
carolling some rural ditty, till the rocks and mountains echoed
with the cadence of her harmony.</p>
<p>Catty, with such capabilities and accomplishments, was of
course an object of wonder, awe, and admiration, to many of the
swains of Tregaron, notwithstanding those &ldquo;delicate
attentions&rdquo; bestowed upon her by Sir Jno. Wynn, bart., but
the success of her <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>original method of tuition made her quite independent of
their protestations.&nbsp; But, altering the sex in the
quotation, we may say that, &ldquo;There is a tide in the affairs
of women;&rdquo; and it proved to be so in Catty&rsquo;s
case.</p>
<p>The right man came at last.&nbsp; Like all her amiable sex,
she professed the utmost abhorrence of mercenary motives in
marriage, though many insinuated that she knew the value of
property from having never possessed any worth mentioning.&nbsp;
It was observed that she treated with indifference, if not
aversion, those unprofitable lovers who had nothing but their
goodly persons to recommend them.</p>
<p>Certain innuendoes were even thrown out respecting a suspicion
of her coquettings with one of the most ugly, miserly, and
repulsive of clowns;&mdash;one who was not only a clown, but a
red-haired one;&mdash;not only knock-kneed, but
squint-eyed;&mdash;not only squint-eyed, but a woman-hater; and
worse than all, a foreigner!&mdash;being a native of a distant
part of the adjoining county of Carmarthen, and known only by the
nick-name of Jack of Sheer G&acirc;r, or Carmarthenshire
Jack.</p>
<p>This person was repulsive in the extreme.&nbsp; Clad in old,
patched, dirty clothes, with such peculiar facial properties as
we have before enumerated, he was apparently the last man upon
whom one of the opposite sex would have cast her favouring
eye.&nbsp; He was at this time chief husbandman and bailiff to
the squire, an office which, giving him power over other
servants, we may be very sure did not increase his
popularity.&nbsp; But few showed their distaste and aversion
openly; it would have been a dangerous experiment with Jack of
Sheer G&acirc;r.</p>
<p>The standing jest against him was, his qualifications as a
trencherman, and his reputation as a &ldquo;huge feeder&rdquo;
was certainly unrivalled.&nbsp; As there was not a single pastime
under the head of amusement, that the ingenuity of man has ever
devised for the entertainment of his fellows, save eating, that
possessed a charm for him, it might of course be expected that <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>this solitary
recreation would be indulged in the proportion that he excluded
all others.&nbsp; He not only performed all the functions of the
gross glutton, but as the actors say, &ldquo;looked the
character,&rdquo; to perfection.</p>
<p>The reader, measuring him by other men, would make a very
erroneous guess on the most prominent feature of his face, if he
fixed on the nasal protuberance&mdash;no such thing&mdash;his
nose was flat and small, but his large projecting upper teeth,
like &ldquo;rocks of pearl jutting over the sea,&rdquo; were ever
bared for action, white as those of his only companion, the
mastiff, and nobly independent of a sheathing lip.</p>
<blockquote><p>Others more comely features might wear<br />
But Jack was famed for his white teeth bare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the squire&rsquo;s lady was not the most liberal in
supplying the servants&rsquo; table, those wags, male or female,
who were in the habit of committing the silent mimicry against
Jack, were soon taught a severe lesson at the expense of their
bowels.&nbsp; It was discovered that, whenever enraged at their
treatment, instead of spending his breath in vain reproaches, or
taking to the more violent proceeding of fisty-cuffs, Jack
revenged himself by eating most outrageously, so that scoffers,
deprived of their shares, often found their stomachs minus.&nbsp;
His power of mastication increased with his anger; and the
flaming energy that was mentally inciting him to give an enemy a
fierce facer, or a destructive cross-buttock, was diverted from
his knuckles to his teeth; and in every quantum which he ground
in his relentless mill, he felt the glowing satisfaction of
having annihilated a foe.</p>
<p>Woe to those who were his next neighbours at table, and sat so
close to his elbows at those hours of excitement; fierce punches
in the ribs, as if by accident, were among the slightest
consequences; and those who were thus taught the manners to keep
a respectable distance, declared that the fears they <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>entertained
was only of his knife.&nbsp; But his bloodthirsty propensities
were not so great as they were represented to be.&nbsp; Jack
believed in the &ldquo;power of the eye,&rdquo; and exemplified
it, in his own case, by making that organ express what his head
never meant to carry out.&nbsp; The squire knew his value as a
faithful servant, and turned a deaf ear to all the evil that was
reported of him.</p>
<p>Before fanaticism had cast its puritanic gloom over Wales, and
identified itself almost with the Welsh in character, mirth and
minstrelsy, dance and song, emulative games and rural pastimes
were the order of the day; and, as the people worked hard all the
week, it must be confessed that these sports often infringed upon
the sanctity of the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Sundays were often entirely spent in dancing, wrestling, and
kicking the foot-ball.&nbsp; The latter violent exercise, at this
time prevalent in Cardiganshire, was performed in large parties
of village against village, and parish against parish, when the
country brought together its mass of population either to partake
in the glories of the game or to enjoy the success of their
friends, as spectators.&nbsp; On these occasions Carmarthen Jack
loved to be present, but only as a spectator, as he was never
known to take a part in the game.</p>
<p>Jack thought the exercise of play was waste of time and
breath.&nbsp; He told others that he &ldquo;kept his breath to
cool his flummery, and his strength to make money.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whilst the others were panting with efforts made in the game,
Jack was quietly cutting and carving his wooden spoons, made out
of the birch or alder which he stored all the week under his bed,
for the purpose of drying it.</p>
<p>At fairs also, Carmarthen Jack would be equally punctual, and
after having done his master&rsquo;s business of buying or
selling a horse or so, would be seen with a load of merchandise
of his own manufacture, wooden spoons, ladles, and clog soles, in
abundance, which drew about him all the rural house-keepers far
and near.&nbsp; <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;No milliner could suit her customers with
gloves&rdquo; in greater variety than Jack with spoons to please
his purchasers.&nbsp; He had spoons for man, woman and child,
fashioned for every sort of mouth, from the tiny infant&rsquo;s
to the shark-jaws of the hungry ploughman, which, like his own,
was said to present a gap from ear to ear.&nbsp; He had spoons
for use, and spoons for ornament; the latter, meant to keep
company with the showy polished pewter, were made of box or yew,
highly polished and curiously carved with divers characters,
supposed to be suns, moons, stars, hearts transfixed with the
dart of cupid, and sometimes a hen and chickens; with
hieroglyphics for fear of their being mistaken for a cat and
mice, with other such misconstructions, Jack always explained at
the time of bargaining, without any extra charge.</p>
<p>Nothing could more emphatically prove the excellency of
Jack&rsquo;s wares, than the circumstance of his being personally
unpopular among the women, and yet his wares in the highest
esteem.&nbsp; The frowns of the fair, which threw a gloom on the
sunshine of his days, may be traced to a source not at all
dishonourable to him.&nbsp; The girls at the squire&rsquo;s had
played him so many tricks, that once in the height of
aggravation, Jack waged war against the whole sex, devoting to
the infernal gods every creature that wore a petticoat, and
vowing, from that day forward, not one of the proscribed race
should ever enter his room, which was romantically situated over
the stable, its wickered lattice commanding a full view of both
the pigsty and the dunghill.</p>
<p>The consequence of this terrible row caused him, at first,
some trouble, as, to keep it, he was obliged thenceforward to be
his own chambermaid, laundress, and sempstress, offices that
accorded ill with his previous habits.&nbsp; The laudable
firmness of his nature, however, soon overcame these petty
difficulties; and so far was he from backsliding from his
previous determination, that he vowed to throw through the window
the first woman who entered his chamber, <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>which the
satirical hussies called his den&mdash;a threat which effectually
secured him from further intrusion.</p>
<p>Sometimes, indeed, while sitting at the door of the cow-house,
or the stable, listening to the rural sounds of the cackling
geese and grunting pigs, and darning his hose, or patching his
leather breeches, or treading his shift in the brook by way of
washing it, those eternal plagues of his, the girls, would be
seen and heard behind the covert of a wall or hedge, smothering
their tittering, which at last would burst out, in spite of
suppression, into a loud horse-laugh, when, one and all, they
would take to their heels, while Jack amused himself by pelting
their rear, in their precipitate retreat, with clods of earth,
small stones or anything that came in his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circumstances alter cases.&rdquo;&nbsp; In time Jack
gained the reputation of being rich.&nbsp; He had made spoons to
some purpose, and however the fair sex may cry up their
disinterestedness, we are all aware that money materially alters
the position of a man in their eyes.&nbsp; One of the maids with
this knowledge, became very suddenly enamoured of him, and tried
to gain his good will.&nbsp; But having one day ventured to
Jack&rsquo;s &ldquo;sanctum,&rdquo; the wench was pitched into
the dunghill below, and as a consequence the &ldquo;pangs of
despised love&rdquo; raged in her bosom.&nbsp; The first act of
her resentment was to spread about the insidious report that Jack
Sheer was a woman-hater&mdash;an insinuation that rather preyed
upon his mind, as he dreaded the effect such an unmerited stigma
would have upon his private trade.&nbsp; But innocence is ever
predestined to an ultimate triumph; and an event soon happened
that proved the falsehood of those prevalent tales to his
discredit, and convinced his greatest foes that he possessed a
heart, if not overflowing with human charity, at least penetrable
to the blandishments of beauty, and quick with sensibility to
female merit.</p>
<p>On one auspicious market-day, Carmarthen Jack appeared in the
streets of Tregaron where the market is held, loaded with his
usual merchandise, which he <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>spread on the ground, and sat beside
them; but not meeting with a ready sale, and disdaining even
momentary idleness, began with earnestness to cut and scoop away
at a piece of alder, gradually forming it into a huge ladle, to
correspond with the largest size three-legged iron pot.&nbsp; On
this eventful morning Catty had occasion to perambulate the fair,
to purchase a new ladle, her cross-grained sister having broken
the old one, by thumping with it on the back of an overgrown hog,
whose foraging propensities had led him to investigate the
recesses of the schoolroom.</p>
<p>The notoriety occasioned by Jack&rsquo;s peculiarities, and
the fact of his having money, reached the ears of Catty, and our
prudent tutor determined to make his acquaintance through the
medium of the broken ladle.&nbsp; Some people say that Catty
broke the ladle herself, broke it with a design and that design
was an excuse for visiting and conquering one who hated all her
sex.&nbsp; Be that as it may, she sought and found him in the
fair, and fell in love with him and his ladle at the same
instant.&nbsp; After an effort to conquer her native bashfulness,
and to look as lovely as possible, she accosted him with such
uncommon civility as utterly astounded the poor clownish
misanthropic bachelor.&nbsp; She examined the ladle in his hand,
and though not half finished, declared it to be the handsomest
ever her eyes beheld, and paid for it without seeking the least
abatement in the price.&nbsp; Jack gaped at her, with open mouth
and staring eyes, and thought her a very interesting woman,
though his first impression was, that she was mad, as he had
asked double the selling price, on purpose to abate one half,
according to the custom immemorial in Welsh dealings.</p>
<p>She next purchased half a dozen common birch-wood spoons, and,
as many ornamental ones made of box, to adorn her shelf, and, as
before paid him his own price.&nbsp; Jack thought her very lovely
indeed: and when she made another purchase of a pair of clog <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>soles, quite
irresistible!&mdash;her ready money opened his heart as the best
key in the world would have done a patent lock; and he was almost
ready to offer them as a present, but for fear of wounding her
delicacy.&nbsp; As she found he had no further variety, she
ordered half a dozen more common spoons, and Jack, with all the
amiability that he could possibly throw into his hard features,
presented her with one of his most finished articles in
box.&nbsp; She received it with that peculiar smile with which a
lady accepts a welcome love-token, and replied in the softest
tone imaginable, &ldquo;Indeed I will keep it for your sake, John
bach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack had nothing to do but wonder&mdash;he never had been
called John in his life before; at any other time he would have
thought she mocked him&mdash;and the endearing term of
&ldquo;bach&rdquo; too, was equally new to his ears, which seemed
to grow longer as they tingled with the grateful sound.&nbsp;
This interesting scene was closed by Catty asking him to her
house to partake of a dinner of flummery and milk, which he
accepted with the best grace imaginable, and trudged off with his
wares on his back and dangling from his arms and button-holes;
and thus gallanting her in the most amatory style; he walked by
her side to Llidiard-y-Fynon.</p>
<p>Unaccustomed to kindness in either word or deed, poor Jack of
Sheer G&acirc;r, met her condescensions and advances with a
sheepish sort of gratitude.&nbsp; A cordial invitation on the
part of Catty to repeat his visit as soon, and as often, as
possible, affected him almost to tears; and as a proof of his
unbounded confidence, he left in her care his whole stock of
ready-made spoons and ladles, and almost blubbered when he shook
her hand at parting.</p>
<p>As a proof of the beneficial effect of kindness on a churlish
nature, and the contrary, of ridicule and persecution, we need
but contrast this rugged man&rsquo;s previous character and
conduct with what followed, after <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>the tenderness of Catty had melted
the frost of misanthropy which formed a crusty coat round his
heart.&nbsp; The adventure of the day produced a most
extraordinary revolution in his habits.&nbsp; None of the
servants of the hall, male or female, could conceive what it
portended, when Jack asked one of them, his fellow husbandman, to
trim his hair; and while the fellow clipped his rough red locks
with his sheep-shears, once mischievously pinching his ear with
them till he roared, he was surprised at his questions about the
price of a new pair of leather breeches, and a red
neck-cloth.&nbsp; Greater still was the astonishment of the whole
house, when, in a few days after, he appeared changed into a
complete rustic buck in those very articles of dress, and while
he thought nobody saw him, endeavoured to cut a dancing caper on
the green, which they mistook for a frisky bullock.&nbsp; Changes
like these are seldom without a reason, thought his fellow
servants; and when they saw Jack&rsquo;s elated steps lead him
towards Catty&rsquo;s house, they jeered, and laughed, and
winked; and nothing knew of course, although their knowledge made
him all the worse.&nbsp; Tregaron and its neighbourhood had now
food for gossip, and gossip to some people is indeed the very
acme of human felicity.</p>
<p>Flummery and milk, named here as the food on which those
lovers regaled, has been considered in Wales a very popular mess,
common, but still a favourite among high and low, and might be
seen on the board of the lord lieutenant of county, as well as on
that of the humblest cottager.&nbsp; The lofty of the land whose
pampered stomachs have turned with loathing from more dainty
dishes in sultry seasons, have welcomed the simplicity of milk
and flummery, as the advocate of native charms would greet the
smilings of a rustic beauty, while the meretricious fair of
fashion would be passed by, neglected.</p>
<p>The English reader will not be offended if I dilate a little
praise of my favourite bowl or platter, (too much to call it a
dish perhaps,) while I explain its <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>nature; and if he be a bloated son of
affluence, overflowing with bile and spleen, he will thank us,
after adopting our recommendation of feeding on it often during
his rustication among our mountains.&nbsp; Our candid sages of
the pill and potion, also recommend it as very effective in
promoting an increase of good clear healthy blood.</p>
<p>Flummery is made of the inner hulls of ground oats, when
sifted from the meal, some of which still adheres to it, by
soaking it in water till it acquires a slight taste of acidity,
when it is strained through a hair sieve and boiled till it
becomes a perfect jelly.&nbsp; When poured from that prince of
culinary vessels, the large three-legged iron pot, into a vast
earthen dish, it presents a smooth smiling aspect of the most
winning equanimity, till destroyed by the numerous invading
spoons of the company, who plunge a portion of it, scalding hot,
into their bowls of cool milk.&nbsp; Thus much of the descriptive
history is given, to illustrate the following ode to its immortal
praise, with which we shall now close this long chapter.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">MILK AND FLUMMERY.</p>
<p>Let luxury&rsquo;s imbecile train,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of appetites fastidious,<br />
Each sauced provocative obtain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The draught or viand perfidious;<br />
But oh! give me that simple food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lov&rsquo;d by the sons of Cymru.<br />
With health, with nourishment imbued,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweet cool milk and flummery.</p>
<p>Let pudding-headed English folk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With boast of roast-beef fag us;<br />
Let Scottish Burns crack rural jokes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And vaunt kail-brose and haggis;<br />
But Cymrian sons, of mount and plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Brecknock to Montgomery,<br />
Let us the honest praise maintain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of sweet cold milk and flummery.</p>
<p>On sultry days when appetites<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wane dull, and low, and queasy,<br />
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>When

Dear oaten jelly, pride of Wales!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou smooth-faced child of Cymry.<br />
On the ruddy swain regales,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And blesses milk and flummery.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis sweet to stroll on Cambrian heights<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er-looking vales and rivers.<br />
Where thin and purest air invites,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The soul from spleen delivers;<br />
That foe of bile the light repast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bloated gout may come wry.<br />
But Nature&rsquo;s child, thy mid-day fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Break thou with milk and flummery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Another</span> lecture in
Welsh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Courting in bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our
hero&rsquo;s education progresses.&nbsp; The Curate&rsquo;s
school.</p>
<p>Whilst our lovers were regaling themselves upon milk and
flummery, Twm Shon Catty was concocting and putting into
execution his first practical joke, for while they sat side by
side at the goodly oak table, he fastened them together by the
coat and gown with a peeled thorn spike, which before the
introduction of pins, was used by the fair sex to unite about
them their various articles of attire.</p>
<p>This freak being performed, Twm stole off unperceived, and
getting on the outside of the door, he was joined by Watt the
mole catcher, and a party of children instructed for the purpose,
in a loud and astounding cry of mad bull! a mad bull! at the same
time forcing before them into the house a little trotting calf,
whose buttocks were tortured by Twm&rsquo;s ox-goad till he
reared and capered up to the very table where the lover&rsquo;s
sat.&nbsp; Catty screamed, and both jumped up mutually terrified,
as sudden fear had <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>magnified the little animal to the proportions of an
enormous brute of an enraged bull, whose uninvited visit and
uncalled for appearance at their dinner table, portending nothing
less than death.&nbsp; When Twm and Watt&rsquo;s laughter at
length undeceived them, the spoon merchant, who had been so
liberally assisted with spoon and meat, found to his dismay, that
with his heart Catty had carried away the skirt of his coat, by
the sudden jerk of rising from their seats; and had the gods made
Jack poetical, he might have exclaimed with the renowned Mr.
Tag,&mdash;<a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The lovely maid on whom I dote<br />
Hath made a spencer of my coat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wicked urchin who caused this unsanctioned union continued
with his mischievous party, their laughter long and loud, and
Catty&rsquo;s grumpy sister Juggy, for the first time in her
life, astonished them with a grin on the occasion.&nbsp; Twm
received a severe rebuke from his parent, and poor hapless Jack,
with the view of propitiating an evil spirit that might prove
troublesome to him hereafter, made him a present of a new spoon,
which, because it was merely a common one he ungratefully threw
into the blazing turf fire, that on this festal occasion glowed
on the hearth in a higher pile and wider dimensions than usual,
and demanded one of his best box-wood ware.</p>
<p>Jack would have given it to him immediately but for the
intervention of his mother, who forbade the indulgence.&nbsp; No
sooner, however, was he gone than Twm watched his opportunity and
purloined as many of the better sort as he could conveniently
take away unperceived, and sold them at the cheap rate of stolen
goods, to an old woman named, or rather nick-named, Rachel Ketch,
from some supposed resemblance in her character to that finisher
of the law, although some persons roundly asserted that she was
in fact a <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>relict of one John Ketch, Esquire, of
Stretch-neck-Place, Session Court, Carmarthen.</p>
<p>As no further consequence followed this act of unprovoked
delinquency, it was scarcely worth mentioning, except that it
stands as the first of the kind on record; and when discovered,
Twm&rsquo;s over affectionate parent did not punish him for
it,&mdash;an omission that might have watered the root of a vast
tree of after enormities, but the mirthful mind rarely produces
such an upas monstrosity.</p>
<p>We come now to the era of his history when our hero entered
another scene of life, in that of a new school, which event was
ushered in by an unlooked-for circumstance, that must be first
narrated.</p>
<p>To our English readers it may be a piece of information if we
make known that in some parts of Wales, &ldquo;Courting in
bed&rdquo; is very common.&nbsp; It was so, at least when the
first and second editions of this work were issued, but now is
confined only to a few particular districts.&nbsp; Some of our
readers may be shocked; but when they are assured that the custom
embraces nothing which is not consistent with the strictest
honour, they will perhaps accord our ancient custom a little more
charity.&nbsp; This comfortable mode of forwarding a marriage
connexion prevailed very generally at Tregaron, to the great
scandal and virtuous indignation of the lady of Squire
Graspacre.&nbsp; It was amazing to witness with what energy this
good gentlewoman set about reforming the people, by the forcible
abolishment of what she pleased to call, this odious, dangerous,
blasphemous, and ungodly custom.</p>
<p>Her patronage was for ever lost to any man or woman, youth or
maid, of the town or country, who was related to, or connected
with any person who connived at bed courtship.&nbsp; There was
not a cottager who called at the great house for a pitcher of
whey, skim milk, or buttermilk, as a return for labour in harvest
time, but was closely examined on this head; and woe to those who
had the temerity to assert that there was no harm in the custom;
or that the wooers <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>merely laid down in their clothes, and thus conversed at
their ease on their future plans or prospects; or who denied that
such a situation was more calculated for amorous caresses and
endearments than sitting by a scanty fire in a chimney
corner.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graspacre was certainly a very virtuous&mdash;a very
termagant of decorous propriety.&nbsp; If any person dared, in
her presence, to advocate this proscribed and utterly condemned
mode, disdaining to argue the point, she would settle the matter
in a summary manner, peculiarly her own, by protesting she would
have a woman burnt alive who would submit to be courted in
bed.</p>
<p>In the course of two years there were no less than four young
men, and twice as many damsels, turned away from her service for
courting in the hay-loft; and on these occasions the poor girls
never escaped personal violence from the indignant and
persevering Mrs. Graspacre.&nbsp; She also assured them in
language undistinguished for choiceness or delicacy, that
&ldquo;they were not to try and hoodwink her by telling her it
meant nothing.&nbsp; She knew better, she had not lived all these
years to be lied to and cheated by a common
w&mdash;e.&rdquo;&nbsp; In her flaming zeal for decorum, the
tongs, the poker, the pitchfork, or the hay-rake, became an
instrument of chastisement.&nbsp; A double advantage was
discovered in the terror thus created, the dignity of her sex
being in the first place asserted and supported: in the next, the
offenders preferred running away without payment of their wages,
to standing the chance of having their heads or arms broken with
a poker, or their bodies pierced by the terrible prongs of a
pitchfork.</p>
<p>All the lowly dependents of Mrs. Graspacre found it their
interest to become her spies, who soon vied with each other in
giving the earliest intimation of any amorous pair who committed
this most diabolical offence; and those who were least forward in
bringing intelligence on this score, immediately sunk in her
esteem, and were mulct of their allowance of skim milk and blue
whey.</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>But in
time the old hen-wives of the neighbourhood discovered the virtue
of sycophancy and the efficacy of a little seasonable cant! and
when they were not warranted by real occurrences, they contrived
to conciliate their patroness by drawing upon their fertile
imagination and inventions; at other times, their knowledge of
Mrs. Graspacre&rsquo;s failing served their own revenge.&nbsp;
Let anybody offend them, and they immediately went to the lady
with a manufactured tale, doing more credit to the imagination
than the heart.&nbsp; Their enemy had been found courting in bed
with Miss So-and-so, which was the signal for immediate
condemnation without trial.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with these auxiliaries in the cause of virtue,
the zealous Mrs. Graspacre enlisted on her side a very powerful
champion, in the person of the reverend Mr. Inco Evans, the
curate of Tregaron.&nbsp; Great was her mortification to find her
attempts on the rector fail of success, as he declared it
dangerous and ungenerous to interfere with the peculiarities and
long-established customs of the people; especially as he
conceived it was rarely that any bad consequences ensued from the
mode in question; but when the evil really occurred, if the
faithless swain delayed making due reparation, a gaol, exile from
his native place, or a compelled marriage, was the consequence, a
penalty incurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; quoth the worthy
rector, with a hearty laugh, &ldquo;that was the very way in
which I courted my own wife, and many persons who are no enemies
of virtue, consider it the best mode in the world, and were I
young again, ha, ha, ha! egad, I think I should pursue the same
fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I too!&rdquo; cries Mr. Graspacre, &ldquo;as I have
no objection in the world to the custom.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
reader&rsquo;s experience of the squire will certainly give him
credit for speaking truth in this instance.&nbsp; The notions of
morality would be highly forwarded by courting in bed.&nbsp; But
as for Mrs. Graspacre, had the faces of all the foul-fiends been
united in one for the purpose of producing a <i>ne plus ultra</i>
of concentrated devilry, it <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>would not have surpassed the amiable
expression upon her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;You, Mr. Graspacre!
<i>you</i>!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m astonished; but&rdquo;&mdash;(with a
severe glance at the rector) &ldquo;when the shepherd goes
astray, no wonder the silly sheep follow his
example!&rdquo;&nbsp; With that, she bounced out of the room, and
slammed the door in a high fit of indignation, aggravated by the
calm looks of the rector, and the provoking tittering of her
liege lord.</p>
<p>The rector&rsquo;s honest dissent from her scheme of
reformation, Mrs. Graspacre considered a direct declaration of
hostilities, and therefore, by her peculiar creed of morality,
she felt herself bound to vilify his name, and most piously
longed for his death, that the cause of virtue might be supported
by the talents of her favourite curate, who was now, she said, on
a poor stipend which he increased by keeping a school in the
church.</p>
<p>The reverend Inco Evans, the curate, played his cards well; he
was a hard-featured man, with lowering brows and a complete
ploughman&rsquo;s gate; insolent to his poor parishioners, and a
very awkward cringer to the great.&nbsp; But flattery, direct or
covert, does much, and in time completely won him the favour of
the great lady.&nbsp; She encouraged his patience by assuring him
that the vicar, in his declined state of health, could not
possibly live long; and his death, happen when it might, must
appear, to all unprejudiced christians, as a judgment, for
advocating, or not prosecuting, that execrable custom courting in
bed.</p>
<p>As the living had long been promised to him, the hopes and
expectations of Mr. Inco Evans were very sanguine.&nbsp; Waiting
for dead men&rsquo;s shoes is rather a wearisome thing,
especially if the object of your affectionate solicitude be
apparently in the best of health; but the curate was hopeful, and
patient; and as he was no less ambitious than sycophantic and
impervious, he looked forward with confidence to the period when
he should strut forth in a fire-shovel hat, as vicar of the
parish, and a magistrate in the county.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that the living was promised him <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>by the lady,
he was aware that she was not always paramount, and therefore
lost no opportunity of insinuating himself in the squire&rsquo;s
favour.&nbsp; He would laugh loudly to the injury of his lungs,
at the squire&rsquo;s most vapid jokes; praise the beauty of his
snub-nosed children, and call curs, pointers; tell him where the
prettiest lasses in the parish were to be found; with many such
<i>honourable</i> civilities, that Squire Graspacre at length
discovered him to be a very useful sort of person.</p>
<p>When Sir John Wynn of Gwydir paid his before mentioned visit,
his sister introduced and recommended our curate, as a right
worthy divine who deserved preferment; and the baronet promised
to remember her recommendation, if anything turned out, within
his power, to benefit him.&nbsp; Much time had elapsed, and
nothing followed this agreeable promise; but Inco Evans
persevered in his sycophancy, and if the labour and dirty work be
properly estimated, he certainly justified his claims to a good
living&mdash;in his majesty&rsquo;s plantations, beyond the seas;
to which he ought to have been inducted at the expense of
government, and, as the artful Dodger says, he should have</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gone abroad for the good of his health,<br
/>
But not at his own expense!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He soon saw the weak side of his lady patroness: and anxious
to strengthen his influence by promoting her views, he gave great
encouragement to those boys in his school who brought him the
piquant tales of their grown up brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Much
scandal was afloat at this time respecting the loves of
Carmarthen Jack and Catty of Llidiard-y-Fynnon; he would almost
have given his right hand to know how it was carried on.&nbsp;
But Jack was wily; and though Catty possessed little
book-learning, she had enough knowledge to outwit the
curate.&nbsp; These lovers only went out at night, and took care
to choose a solitary place for their meetings, so that getting
information <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>was, in their case, difficult of attainment.&nbsp; At
length the cunning man thought he had hit upon a plan.</p>
<p>Little Twm Shon Catty, being the natural child of Sir John
Wynn, was of course the illegitimate nephew of the great lady; a
relationship which she, however, disdained to acknowledge; but
the cunning curate took the liberty of observing one day, it was
a great pity that the slightest drop of the noble blood of the
Wynns, however perverted and polluted, should be run to waste and
be neglected.&nbsp; Proceeding in this drift, he insinuated that
if the boy Twm Shon Catty were removed to his school, he should
not only be instructed and improved, but that he, the curate,
might thereby learn from the youngster something of his
mother&rsquo;s proceedings; and especially, whether she
entertained her lover in the legal or the proscribed
manner.&nbsp; This was striking on the very string that made
music to her busy, meddling, troublesome soul;&mdash;she of
course warmly approved of his idea, and put it into immediate
execution.&nbsp; Thus, the very next day, in her own and in her
brother&rsquo;s name, little Twm Shon Catty was ordered for the
future to be sent to the curate&rsquo;s school, which of course
was complied with accordingly.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> progresses at
the opposition school.&nbsp; Flogging made easy.&nbsp; Out of the
frying-pan into the fire.&nbsp; Sports at Whirligoogan.</p>
<p>The great success of Catty&rsquo;s school excited the ill-will
of parson Inco; although he had far more scholars than he could
possibly attend to.&nbsp; His indignation at his wife&rsquo;s
fall from her horse into the well, while passing his humble
rival&rsquo;s seminary, together with the humiliating
consideration that many <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>of the most juvenile deserted his
rule, to submit to hers, wounded this consequential personage to
the quick.&nbsp; Like the fox and the grapes, he sneered at that
which was out of his reach, protested that the &ldquo;room&rdquo;
of those scholars who had deserted him was much better than their
company.</p>
<p>This new arrangement respecting Twm, they thought could not
but be vexatious to Catty, and therefore Mistress Evans felt
herself avenged for the tittering that she heard in her school,
on her fall into the well as before mentioned.&nbsp; But far
different was the case from what they anticipated, for Catty no
sooner heard the order, than in the sincerity of her heart, she
exclaimed, &ldquo;Thank God! the boy will learn something from
the parson, but I could teach him nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Twm was now in his seventh year, and as refractory a
pupil as ever was spoiled by a dawdling mother.&nbsp; Kept aloof
from his dear duck-ponds and puddles, and compelled to explore
the mysteries of the horn-book, this first change in his life was
acutely felt.&nbsp; Self-willed and stubborn, he conceived the
utmost abhorrence of horn-books, cross curates, and birch-rods;
he wept and sulked, struck the boys who mocked him, stayed away
from school, and was flogged so often, that at length he found it
much easier to learn his book than endure the consequence of
neglecting it.</p>
<p>Once arrived at this happy mood, and being one day praised by
his master, a new spirit possessed the boy; he resolved to
revenge himself on those youths who formerly had made him their
butt of ridicule, by getting the start of them in learning.&nbsp;
The horn-book was soon thrown by; the Reading-made-easy and
Spelling-book shared a similar fate; and the pride of a young
heart sparkled in his eyes when his great lady aunt, on hearing a
good account of him from his master, presented him with a bible,
on the inside of the cover of which was the following
couplet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Take this Holy Bible book,<br />
God give thee grace therein to look.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>A
specimen of poetry which was considered by everybody to be the
index to a master-mind.&nbsp; Mount Parnassus was scaled, and
that by an inhabitant of Tregaron!&nbsp; Poor Catty proudly
showed the book and the poetry to all her neighbours, who sagely
declared Mrs. Graspacre&rsquo;s bounty and poetry equally
fine.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his rapid advancement in book learning, parson
Evans was far from being satisfied with his pupil, nor was his
main end answered in having brought him to his school.&nbsp; Twm
loved his mother, and felt no great affection for his master, nor
gratitude for the floggings which had enforced so much learning
into his head; and never could the generous boy be brought to
tell any tales to her disadvantage.&nbsp; The curate&rsquo;s
severity increased, and no longer praised or encouraged; Twm
became not only indifferent to his tasks, but wanton and unjust
severity had the effect of blunting his feelings; and making him
stubborn and revengeful; until at length he arrived at such an
extremity of youthful recklessness, as to study tricks for the
annoyance of his master, and the scholars whom he found
unfriendly.</p>
<p>In the eleventh year of his age, some decisive shoots of
character made their appearance; a taste for sharp sayings, a
skilful trickery in outwitting his opponents, appear to be his
striking peculiarities, as well as boldness and resolution on the
play-ground, where none could surpass him in robust or violent
exercises.&nbsp; His faithful ally and constant instructor, Watt
the mole catcher, taught him many useful and <i>striking</i>
lessons when the pedagogue had done with our hero for the
day.&nbsp; Twm, under his tuition, soon became proficient in the
use of cudgels and quarter-staff.</p>
<p>More particular in the latter he excelled; and his superiority
in this ancient and national exercise was exemplified by the loud
cries and broken heads of his defeated schoolfellows.&nbsp; A
catastrophe of that kind one day, even in school-time, brought
the enraged master out, who severely asked Twm what he meant by
such <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>conduct.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; cried the little
rogue, &ldquo;You always say that you never can beat anything
into the head of Peter Penddwl, so I tried what I could do with
the cudgel, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;&nbsp; For this he was booked
for a future flogging.&nbsp; A few days after, his master sent
him from the school to his house, for a book which he wanted.</p>
<p>Twm found the mistress and maid out, the first at the Hall,
and the last had made a present of her little leisure to her
sweetheart, Watt the mole-catcher.&nbsp; On entering the parlour,
he saw there a fine bunch of grapes, which his great lady aunt
had sent his master.&nbsp; As this was a fruit hitherto unknown
to him, he deliberately tasted two or three to discover whether
they were eatable.&nbsp; Having gradually seen the bunch grow
&ldquo;beautifully less,&rdquo; it seemed a pity to separate the
lovely fruit, so Twm thought they should all go the same way.</p>
<p>He therefore resolved to finish it, and lay the blame on the
cat, if charged with the theft; as to dividing the spoil, and
leaving a portion for the owner, the scheme was impracticable, he
decided to abide by his master&rsquo;s maxim, &ldquo;that it was
not decent for two to eat from the same dish.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lifting up the remains of the luscious bunch with affected
ceremony, he exclaimed in a lofty tone, mimicking his master,
&ldquo;I publish the banns of marriage between my mouth and this
bunch of grapes; if any one knows just cause or impediment why
they should not be joined together, let him now declare it, or
hereafter forever, hold his peace!&rdquo;&nbsp; And as no
dissentient voice intervened, he abruptly
cried&mdash;&ldquo;silence gives consent,&rdquo; and hastily
consummated the delicious union.</p>
<p>No sooner had he gulped the grapes than his master made his
appearance.&nbsp; Suspecting the cause of his delay, he had
followed after, and witnessing the imposing ritual, he stood, rod
in hand, surrounded by his scholars, whom he had called.&nbsp;
When all was in readiness, he exclaimed, &ldquo;I publish the
banns of marriage between my rod and your breech; if any <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>one knows
just cause or impediment why they may not be lawfully joined
together in wedlock, let him now declare it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forbid the banns!&rdquo; roared Twm Shon Catty;
&ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo; cried the awful pedant,
flourishing his rod in eager preparation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; cried the waggish urchin, &ldquo;the
parties are not agreed.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this moment a servant
from Graspacre Hall brought a message from the lady of that
mansion, that she wished to see the Reverend Mr. Inco Evans
immediately; on which Twm obtained a remission of his
flogging.&nbsp; History does not furnish us with satisfactory
particulars as to whether Twm was liberated on account of his
ready wit, or because necessity demanded it, the pedagogue being
in a hurry.</p>
<p>The boys were now thrilled to ecstasy with that magic word, a
&ldquo;holiday!&rdquo; and away scampered each and all to their
respective amusements.&nbsp; Briefly, however, was their gust of
enjoyment, for parson Inco&rsquo;s voice was soon heard,
vociferating his wrath in no gentle terms; and now he appeared in
his shirt sleeves, his best Sunday sable coat in his hand,
divested of every button.</p>
<p>His face at no time prepossessing, was now terrible to look
on, inflamed with anger, with a slight tint of blue-black over
his native strong ground of turkey-red.&nbsp; Great was the
terror of the poor enslaved scholars as he howled out &ldquo;What
villain has cut off all the buttons from my coat?&rdquo;&nbsp; A
general whimper of, &ldquo;it was not I, sir,&rdquo; passed among
the shivering train.&nbsp; And upon Mr. Inco&rsquo;s threat to
flog them all round unless the culprit was instantly discovered,
one blue-nosed wretch, upon whom Evans had seized to commence his
vengeance, roared out that it was Twm Shon Catty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where is the young catiff?&rdquo; roared the Reverend Mr.
Inco Evans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing at whirligoogan on the horseblock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll whirligoogan him with a vengeance,&rdquo;
roared the Tyro, at the same time snatching up his terrific bunch
of birch which he had facetiously christened the tree of
knowledge.&nbsp; Either from having a foreboding of the <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>cause of this
bustle, or being timely warned of the approaching danger, Twm had
now made good his retreat, wisely considering that
&ldquo;Discretion was the better part of valour,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;He who fights and runs away, may live to fight another
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that at the precise moment when the curate
thought Twm&rsquo;s presence desirable, that happy individual,
not the least afraid, was busy sketching a caricature of his
master.</p>
<p>The materials were blank wall, a piece of chalk, and an
extensive imagination, whilst he took care to place this artistic
production within the precincts of a small house never visited
except when absolutely necessary, but where he knew the curate
would be able to study the fine arts at his leisure, though
possibly it might turn out to be the &ldquo;pursuit of knowledge
under difficulties.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the horse-block, however, was
found his stock of whirligigs, which the Welsh boys called the
whirligoogans.&nbsp; These were no other than the identical
button moulds, which our hero had cut from the best gala-day coat
of the Reverend Inco Evans, with pegs driven through each centre
hole, so that when twirled between finger and thumb, on the
surface of the horse-block, they became the puerile pastime of
the younger scholars, who preferred &ldquo;Whirligoogan&rdquo; to
the more robust exercise of the ball or bandy.</p>
<p>Baffled in his present vengeance, parson Inco shuffled off
towards the house, and covered his buttonless coat with his gown
and cassock, vowing inwardly, as he adjusted his dress, future
chastisement, in the superlative degree, against our hero.&nbsp;
Unfortunately at this luckless moment, a perverse hog that seemed
to enter into the spirit of this disastrous hour, having risen
from his bed of mud in the horse-pond, where he had dreamed and
philosophised away the whole morning, was making his way towards
the feeding trough, when a lean and sour household cur which
appeared to envy him his swinish beauty, and easy-life
rotoundity, maliciously bit him in the breech, and drove him
snorting between the legs of the newly-dressed curate; so that <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>the reverend
gentleman was thrown headlong into the mass of muck, uniting the
nature of matter and fluidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son of Catty shall pay for all,&rdquo; muttered the
enraged Inco Evans, as the servant cleansed his soiled
sables.&nbsp; Thus when poor Twm was flogged next morning, with
the leniency that the tired arm of the pedagogue alone afforded,
he had to answer for the sins of the hog and the dog as well as
his own&mdash;and all for playing whirligoogan with the
parson&rsquo;s buttons!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Mr. Graspacre</span>
upholds the national customs, and Welsh custom receives his
support.&nbsp; A &ldquo;tiff&rdquo; with Lady Graspacre.&nbsp;
The squire defends bed courtships.&nbsp; Newcastle Emlyn
Ale.&nbsp; Thirsty rats.</p>
<p>At this time a warm altercation one day took place between the
squire and his lady, which terminated in consequences little
expected by either.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the prejudice to which
Squire Graspacre&rsquo;s harsh conduct had given birth, on his
first settlement in Cardiganshire, he had about him certain
saving points, that not only reconciled them to his rule, but
really gained their esteem.&nbsp; He was a plain, bold, sensible
man, and although entertaining a most exalted opinion of English
superiority, generally, in particular instances he had the
liberality to confess that he found things in this nation of
mountaineers highly worthy of imitation among his more civilized
brethren.</p>
<p>There are many exceptions like the squire, but we are sorry to
add that in Wales we have more illiberal Englishmen, who sneer at
all Welsh customs, because they are Welsh, than people would
dream of.&nbsp; They forget that our usages are as dear to us, as
theirs to them, and that however peculiar they may be in the eyes
of an Englishman, the Welshman considers them <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>a <i>sine qua
non</i> of his own nationality.&nbsp; But these instances are
fast dying out.&nbsp; Railroads, free and continued intercourse,
and a liberal spirit of toleration, enable the Englishman to see
our custom and our usages in a different light.</p>
<p>He had formerly expressed his disapprobation of a custom
prevalent among Welsh farmers of leaving their corn a long time
on the ground after being cut, instead of housing it as soon as
possible; but experience taught him that they were right and
himself in error; among the corn was a large quantity of weeds,
which required to be dried, before it could with safety be
brought to the barn or the rick, otherwise the grain was sweated,
and literally poisoned with the rank juice.&nbsp; He found the
Cardiganshire mode of cropping the young mountain furze, and
giving it as food for horses and cattle, worthy of his attention,
and after various trials, decided on its efficacy so far as to
adopt it for the future; and actually set Carmarthen Jack to
gather the seed of that mountain plant, which he forwarded to
England to be sown and reared on his Devonshire farms.</p>
<p>The planting of flowers on the graves of deceased friends, he
eulogized as a beautiful and endearing custom, forming an
agreeable contrast to the clumsy English tombstones with
barbarous lines, often setting truth, rhyme and reason at
defiance.&nbsp; The Welsh harp he declared the prince of all
musical instruments, and Welsh weddings the best contrived, and
conducted in the best manner in the world, and proved his
sincerity by always giving something at the <i>Biddings</i> of
the peasantry, and patronizing all those who entered that happy
state.&nbsp; Above all things he admired the female costume in
Wales, and protested with much truth, that the poor people in
England were not half so well or so neatly clothed.</p>
<p>His lofty lady, although a Welshwoman bred and born,
entertained a very different set of ideas on these
subjects.&nbsp; Whenever her husband related the anecdote of
Polydore Virgil&rsquo;s ecstacy on his first landing <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>in Britain,
when he beheld the yellow-blossomed furze, which gave a golden
glow to the swelling bosom of the hills&mdash;how he knelt on the
ground beside a bush of it, fervently worshipping the God of
Nature, that beautified the world with the production of such a
plant; she would instantly reply, &ldquo;The man was a fool! for
<i>my part</i> I see nothing in the nasty prickly thing to
admire, but wish the fire would burn them all from one end of the
mountains to the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, my dear,&rdquo; he would answer,
&ldquo;Polydore Virgil was a native of no rude soil, but came
from the land of the laurel, the cypress, and the vine, the
orange, the lemon, and the citron, and many other splendid
plants, the very names of which you perhaps never heard of; yet
he had the liberality to admire what he justly deemed beautiful,
even in a northern clime, and a comparatively harsh mountainous
district.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to the harp, whenever he praised its melody, she declared
it odious and unbearable, and gave preference to the fiddle, the
bagpipes, or even the hurdy-gurdy; and the Welsh female costume
she protested still more loudly against, and asked him with a
sneer if he did not conceive it capable of improvement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, my dear,&rdquo; would he reply;
&ldquo;for instance, I would have the Glamorganshire girls wear
shoes, and feet to their stockings, and convert their awkward
wrappers into neat gowns; the Cardiganshire fair ones should doff
their clogs, and wear leathern shoes; and the Breconshire lass,
with all others who follow the abominable habit, should be
hindered from wearing a handkerchief around the head; but I know
of no improvement that can be suggested for the Pembrokeshire
damsel, except <i>one</i> which would be equally applicable to
all Welsh girls,&mdash;namely, to throw off their flannel shifts
and wear linen ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now this good gentlewoman, whose leading weakness it was to
suspect her husband&rsquo;s fidelity when from home, kindled with
rage at this remark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shifts, Mr. Graspacre,&rdquo;
exclaimed the angered lady, &ldquo;what <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>business have
you to concern yourself about such matters?&nbsp; You ought, at
least, to know nothing about such matters, but I dare say you
know too much.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s but one woman&rsquo;s shifts
in the world of which you ought to know anything, but no, you
seem to know the cut of every girl&rsquo;s shifts, and you
couldn&rsquo;t get that experience without other of a different
kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxious as a seaman to turn his bark from the direction of a
dangerous rock, he mildly replied, &ldquo;Surely, my dear, I may
exercise my eyes, when the washed clothes are bleaching on the
hedge,&rdquo; and then adding in the same breath, &ldquo;indeed,
if I were you, my dear, I would make some improvements, <i>such
as your good taste will suggest</i>, among our own maids; taking
care however, not to destroy the stamp of nationality on their
garbs at any rate.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a well-judged hit on his
part, and had the effect of averting the impending storm.</p>
<p>It should have been mentioned before, that the squire, soon
after his marriage, had made a tour of South Wales, and, as his
lady expressed it, taken a whim in his head of engaging a maid
servant in every county through which he passed; so that in
Graspacre Hall there were to be found maiden representatives in
their native costumes, of all the different shires in South
Wales, except Radnor, in which, the squire said, the barbarous
jargon of Herefordshire, and the English cottons, had supplanted
the native tongue and dress of Wales.&nbsp; There might you see
the neat maiden of Pembrokeshire in her dark cloth dress of one
hue, either a dark brown approximating to black, or a claret
colour, made by the skill of a tailor, and very closely
resembling the ladies&rsquo; modern riding-habit,&mdash;a perfect
picture of comfort and neatness, in alliance with good taste.</p>
<p>There would you see the extreme contrast, the Glamorganshire
lass in stockings cut off at the ankle, and without shoes; and,
although a handsome brunette with fine black eyes, dressed in a
slammatkin check wrapper of cotton and wool, utterly shapeless,
and tied <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>about the middle like a wheat-sheaf, or a faggot of
wood; possessing, however, the peculiar convenience that it could
be put on in an instant, without the loss of time in dressing
tastefully, and that it would fit every body alike, as it is
neither a gown nor a bedgown, but between both, and without a
waist.</p>
<p>There would you see the young woman of Breconshire, with her
pretty blushing face, half hidden in a handkerchief which
envelops her head that at first you would fancy the figure before
you to be a grandmother at least.&nbsp; Her long linsey gown is
pinned up behind, each extreme corner being joined together in
the centre, and confined a few inches below her waist; she has
her wooden-soled shoes for every day, and leathern ones for
Sunday, or for a dance, which, with her stockings, she very
economically takes off should a shower of rain overtake her on a
journey; and when it ceases, washes her feet in the first brook
she meets, and puts them on again.&nbsp; Some might term this a
curious method of appreciating the protective excellence of the
shoemaker&rsquo;s art, but a Welsh girl, or rather, a Breconshire
girl studies economy quite as much as comfort, and considers her
shoes to be made as much for ornament as for use, and rather
more.</p>
<p>This fair one takes especial care that her drapery shall be
short enough to discover her pretty ankle, and her apron
sufficiently scanty to disclose her gay red petticoat with black
or white stripes, beneath, and at the sides.&nbsp; Then comes the
stout Carmarthenshire lass, with her thick bedgown and petticoat
of a flaring brick-dust red, knitting stockings as she walks, and
singing a loud song as she cards or spins.</p>
<p>Lastly, though not least in importance, behold the clogged and
cloaked short-statured woman of Cardiganshire.&nbsp; She scorns
the sluttish garb and bare feet of the Glamorganshire maiden, and
hates the abominable pride of the Pembrokeshire lass who is vain
enough to wear leathern shoes instead of honest clogs; proving at
the same time that her own vanity is of a more pardonable
stamp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank God too, that she <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>is not vain
like the others are.&nbsp; Yet in her thanks shows vanity,&rdquo;
while she boasts with truth, that her dress costs twice as much
as either of the others.&nbsp; The Cardiganshire woman&rsquo;s
dresses, in fact&mdash;generally blue, with red stripes and bound
at the bottom with red or blue worsted caddis, are entirely of
wool, solidly woven and heavy, consequently more expensive than
those made of linsey or minco, or of the common intermixture of
wool and cotton, and presenting an appearance of weighty warmth,
equally independent of a comely cut and tasty neatness.</p>
<p>It was one of the squire&rsquo;s fancies never to call these
girls by their proper names, but by that of their shires, as
thus, &ldquo;Come here little Pembroke, and buckle my shoe: and
you Carmarthen, bring me a bason of broth; Cardigan, call
Glamorgan and Brecon, and tell them they must drive a harrow a
piece through the ploughed part of Rockfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his return to dinner, a few days after the suggestion about
the dresses of the maids, he was astonished to find that Mrs.
Graspacre had used her privilege with a vengeance; having with
decided bad taste, put them all, <i>at their own expense</i>, to
be deducted from their wages, into glaring cotton prints.</p>
<p>The girls were unhappy enough at this change, as well as at
the expense thus incurred, and they could not enter the town
without experiencing the ridicule of their friends and
neighbours; the Cardiganshire maid, who considered such a change
in the light of disowning her country, and like a renegade
putting on the livery of the Saxon, in something of a termagant
spirit, tendered her resignation to her master rather than comply
with such an innovation.</p>
<p>This ungenerous invasion of his harmless rules, roused his
indignation; and after venting a few &ldquo;damns,&rdquo; <i>a la
John Bull</i>, against draggle-tail cotton rags, without a word
of expostulation with his rib, he desired the girls to bring all
their trumpery to him, which they gladly did, and he made them
instantly into a bonfire in the farm-yard.&nbsp; Then in a firm
undertone <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>of subdued resentment, gave strict injunctions that no
further liberties should be taken with their national costume; to
which his lady made the polite and submissive reply, that the
girls might all walk abroad without any dress at all if he chose,
and go to the devil his own way.</p>
<p>At this juncture little Pembroke came in with rosy smiles, and
told her master that Carmarthen Jack wanted to speak to him very
particularly, on which the squire laughed, and asked on what
<i>important</i> matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said the
rustic beauty, while arch smiles and blushes contended in her
sweet oval face, &ldquo;Parson Inco has found out that he has
been courting in bed, with Catty the schoolmistress, and he has
run here before the parson to say it is all a
falsehood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an impious rascal for you!&rdquo; cried
the lady of the house, &ldquo;to charge the clergyman with a
falsehood; but I am sure &rsquo;tis true, for I long suspected
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, your own dignity and delicacy ought to suggest
to you that the less you interfere in these matters the more
creditable it will be to your own common sense,&rdquo; said the
squire, in a tone which was unmistakable.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
insist,&rdquo; cried the imperious dame, &ldquo;that he be put in
the stocks, and be ducked in the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither shall be done,&rdquo; said he firmly,
&ldquo;and from henceforward no person shall be annoyed or
persecuted on that score, but everyone shall court as he or she
pleases.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the indignant
lady, &ldquo;would you fill the country with bastards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but with as
happy a set of people as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged by the turn which affairs had taken, the
Cardiganshire maid now asked her master for her discharge; as her
mistress, she said, had thrown a slur on her brewing abilities,
which had almost broken her heart; &ldquo;for&rdquo; said she,
with a ludicrous whimper, &ldquo;she says my brewing is unfit for
the drinking of Christian people, and hardly worthy of the
hogs!&mdash;but,&rdquo; cried the sturdy little wench, raising
her voice <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>to an accusatory pitch, and at the same time a tone of
triumph, &ldquo;I came from Newcastle Emlyn, the country of good
beer, the very home where the <i>Cwrw da</i> of <i>Hen Gymru</i>
<a name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a> is bred and born, and I would rather
die than be told that I can&rsquo;t brew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Cardy,&rdquo; said the squire, with a smile,
&ldquo;though your mistress may have been too severe in her
censure, I must say that your two last brewings were unequal to
the first.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A good reason why, sir; who can
brew without malt and hops? who can make bricks without
straw?&nbsp; I hear some of the great London brewers do without
either malt or hops, but I wouldn&rsquo;t drink their brewings, I
know; their brewings won&rsquo;t do for us at Newcastle Emlyn!
and your wheat, <a name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"
class="citation">[50b]</a> sir, which has grown by being cut in
the wet harvest, so as to be unfit for bread, is but a poor
make-shift for malt&mdash;it may do for the wish-wash paltry
brewers&rsquo; ale of Haverfordwest and Fishguard, or the Swansea
folk, Merthyr blacks, and Cardiff boys, but our ploughboys would
turn up their noses at such stuff at Newcastle Emlyn!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn Newcastle Emlyn!&rdquo; cried the squire, provoked
by her continual reference to her native place.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Master! master!&rdquo; cried the girl, as if rebuking him
for the greatest impiety conceivable, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t damn
Newcastle Emlyn; I had rather you should knock me down than damn
Newcastle Emlyn! it is the country of decent people and good
home-brewed ale,&mdash;the country where&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brewed good ale from the grown wheat the first
time,&rdquo; said the squire, not deeming it necessary to notice
her observations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! was it?&rdquo; retorts the girl, struggling
between respect for her master and contempt for his taste in the
matter of malt drink; &ldquo;good was it!&nbsp; I tell you what,
master, you are a good master, and I have nothing to <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>say against
mistress, for it would not be decent, but you never tasted beer
like ours at Newcastle Emlyn! the real hearty <i>cwrw da</i>!
which I could make you to-morrow, if you would give me good malt
and hops, and let it stand long enough untapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Cardy, there must be a sound reason for your two
last brewings being inferior to the first.&nbsp; You could brew a
well-flavoured, palatable beer, but you don&rsquo;t now, although
you have the same ingredients given you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last was better, a good deal, than the other.&nbsp;
The first would have turned the devil&rsquo;s stomach, had he
known what was in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain yourself,&rdquo; said the squire,
surprised.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will, sir, if I were to be hanged for
it,&rdquo; cried the girl in a tone of confidence; &ldquo;it
seems that rats love beer as well as any christian folks, and get
drunk and die in drink, as a warning to all sober-minded rats;
but that is neither here nor there, and I hate to tell a
rigmarole story; the long and the short of it is, that when I
came to wash out the barrels after the first brewing, I found
three rats in one, and two in the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found what?&rdquo; asked the squire and his lady at
the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found three rats, sir, that had burst themselves with
drinking beer, and afterwards fell in and were drowned&mdash;they
were then putrid, and it was that, it seems, that made the ale so
palatable; there were no dead animals in the last brewing, so
that of course it wasn&rsquo;t so &lsquo;palatable&rsquo; and
well-flavoured as the other.&nbsp; But had I known your mind I
might have killed a couple of cats, or put you in a bushel of
lively cockroaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This explanation excited a titter among the girls, and a loud
laugh from the squire, while the lady evinced the shock which her
delicacy had sustained, by making wry faces, and snuffing
violently at her smelling-bottle to avoid fainting.</p>
<p>The squire good-humouredly addressed the
girl,&mdash;&ldquo;now, Cardy, you are perfectly right in the
praise you bestow on your own country ale, and I promise <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>you shall
have the best of malt and hops for your next attempt, when I
expect it to be equal to the best <i>cwrw da</i> of Newcastle
Emlyn&mdash;and, do you hear? we shall dispense with either rats
or cats in it for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This amicable settlement of differences set every one in good
humour, except the haughty mistress, who, embittered with her
double defeat, retired in gloom, while her husband went to give
audience to Jack of Sheer G&acirc;r.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> manners
and customs&rdquo; attendant on a Welsh Wedding.&nbsp; The
Bidding.&nbsp; The Gwahoddwr.&nbsp; The Ystavell.&nbsp; Pwrs a
Gwregys.&nbsp; Pwython.&nbsp; In which our hero and his friend
Watt play rather important parts.</p>
<p>Carmarthen Jack had not been long waiting for his master,
before little Pembroke full of glee, ran to inform him that the
embargo had been taken for ever off bed courtship; and that he
was now free whether guilty or not.&nbsp; This happy news
affected him so well that he met his master with comparative
ease; and after some struggles with his native bashfulness, an
important secret came out&mdash;that he was going to be married
to Catty the schoolmistress; and wished to know whether he should
be retained in the squire&rsquo;s service after that event.</p>
<p>Now this was a circumstance exactly to the squire&rsquo;s
taste; as a Welsh wedding portrayed many national features in the
character of the peasantry, that pleased him; and, as he was
generally a donor on these occasions, his vanity was flattered by
being looked up to as their patron.&nbsp; He of course acquiesced
in his servant&rsquo;s request, and after a little jocular and
rough rallying, <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>proposed that the <i>Bidding</i> should be immediately
commenced.</p>
<p>A <i>Bidding</i> was another of the excellent customs peculiar
to the Welsh, but of late years confined exclusively to the lower
classes, which the squire so much admired, and considered worthy
of imitation, he said, throughout the world.&nbsp; It signifies a
general and particular invitation to all the friends of the bride
and bridegroom elect, to meet them at the houses of their
respective parents, or any other place appointed.&nbsp; Any
strangers who choose to attend are also made welcome.&nbsp; It is
an understood thing that every person who comes, contributes a
small sum towards making a purse for the young pair to begin the
world with.&nbsp; They have a claim on those persons whose
weddings they had themselves attended; and at these times their
parents and friends also make their claims in their favour on all
whom they may have at any time befriended in a similar
manner.&nbsp; These donations are always registered, and
considered as debts, to be repaid, on the occurrence of weddings
only; but there are many contributors, especially the masters and
mistresses of the parties, that of course require no
repayment.&nbsp; These returns being made only by small
instalments, and only at the weddings of their donors, are easily
accomplished; and the benefit derived from this custom is great,
where the parties are respected.</p>
<p>A novel feature, to those who have been unaccustomed to the
Welsh wedding, is the Gwahoddwr or Bidder, who goes from house to
house, with his staff of office&mdash;a white wand embellished
with ribbons.&nbsp; His hat, and often the breast of his coat, is
similarly decorated.&nbsp; Thus attired, he enters each house
with suitable &ldquo;pride of place,&rdquo; amidst the smiles of
the old people, and giggling of the young ones; and taking his
stand in the centre of the house, and striking his wand on the
floor to enforce silence, announces the wedding which is to take
place, sometimes in rhyme, but more frequently in a set speech of
prose.</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>The
banns were immediately put in, and every preparation made for the
wedding.&nbsp; Watt the mole-catcher, as the greatest wag in the
parish, was appointed by the squire to the enviable office of
<i>Gwahoddwr</i>.&nbsp; The following homely lines, from a
correct and liberal translation of those written for the purpose
of giving Watt&rsquo;s oratory full scope on this occasion.&nbsp;
The Rev. John David Rhys, a young poetical clergyman, at this
time a visitor with Squire Graspacre, was the author; and though
they do not betoken the &ldquo;unapproachable of
Parnassus,&rdquo; they yet suited the purpose for which they were
penned.</p>
<blockquote><p>List to the Bidder!&mdash;a health to all<br />
Who dwell in this house, both great and small;<br />
Prosperity&rsquo;s comforts ever attend<br />
The Bride and Bridegroom&rsquo;s generous friend.</p>
<p>His door may it never need a latch;<br />
His hearth a fire, his cottage a thatch;<br />
His wife a card, or a spinning-wheel;<br />
His floor a table, nor on it a meal!</p>
<p>On Saturday next a wedding you&rsquo;ll see,<br />
In fair Tregaron, as gay as can be,<br />
Between John Rees, called Jack o Sheer G&acirc;r,<br />
And Catherine Jones, his chosen fair.</p>
<p>Haste to the wedding, its joy to share!<br />
Mirth and good humour shall meet you there;<br />
Come one, come all: there&rsquo;s a welcome true<br />
To master and mistress and servants too!</p>
<p>Stools you will find to sit upon,<br />
And tables, and goodly food thereon,<br />
Butter and cheese, and flesh and fish,<br />
(If you can catch them!) all you wish.</p>
<p>There many a lad shall a sweetheart find,<br />
And many a lass meet a youth to her mind,<br />
While nut-brown ale, both good and strong,<br />
Shall warm the heart for the dance and song.</p>
<p>Oft at the wedding are matches made,<br />
When dress&rsquo;d in their best come youth and maid,<br />
And dance together, and whisper and kiss.&mdash;<br />
Who knows what wedding may rise from this.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Whoever
may come to the bidding note,&mdash;<br />
There&rsquo;s thanks to the friend who brings three groat;<br />
And ne&rsquo;er may they hobble upon a crutch<br />
Whoe&rsquo;er gives the lovers twice as much!</p>
<p>Whatever is given, so much they&rsquo;ll restore&mdash;<br />
One shilling or two, or three, or four,<br />
Whenever in similar case &rsquo;tis claim&rsquo;d,<br />
Else were defaulters ever shamed. <a name="citation55"></a><a
href="#footnote55" class="citation">[55]</a></p>
<p>So haste to the wedding, both great small,<br />
Master and mistress and servants all!<br />
Catty at home, Jack&rsquo;s at the sign of the Cat;<br />
Now God save the king and the bidder Watt!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During this hubbub and preparation, Twm Shon Catty was granted
the glorious privilege of a week&rsquo;s holiday, and his friend
Watt took him along with him to every house where he had to act
as bidder.&nbsp; To see, was to learn with Twm, and to learn was
to imitate.&nbsp; The thought soon struck him that he might be a
<i>Gwahoddwr</i>; so he at once cut a stout willow wand, peeled
it, and tacked a bunch of carpenter&rsquo;s shavings and rush
flags to the top.&nbsp; Forth he went, and standing in the midst
of a group of admiring boys and girls, proceeded to imitate Watt
in every motion.&nbsp; On this occasion it is said he invoked the
aid of the tuneful nine, and composed the following effusion, but
we <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>suspect
that he was only the mouthpiece to the real poet.</p>
<p>After Watt had finished, our hero struck <i>his</i> emblem of
office upon each floor, and repeated the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Who&rsquo;ll come to the wedding of Catty my
mother?<br />
Come mother, come daughter, son, father, brother,<br />
And bring all your cousins, and uncles, and aunts,<br />
To revel the feast at our jolly courants.<br />
Haste, haste to the Bidding, ye stingy scrubs!<br />
And out with your purses, and down with your dubs.</p>
<p>Come Gwenny and Griffith, and Roger and Sal;<br />
Morgan, Meredith, and Peggy and Pal;<br />
Come one, come all, with your best on back,<br />
To see mother married to spoon-making Jack;<br />
He&rsquo;s a spoon for his pains, as ye all shall see soon,<br />
But lucky at finding a bowl to his spoon.</p>
<p>Haste, haste to the Bidding! my friends, if you please,<br />
For lack of white money bring good yellow cheese,<br />
And butter, but not in your pockets alack,<br />
Bring bacon or mutton well dried on the rack.<br />
So endeth my story; come, haste we, friend Watty;<br />
Now God save the King, and his friend Twm Shon Catty!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s delivery of these lines excited much mirth and
laughter, and, added to those of the real <i>Gwahoddwr</i>, drew
more than ordinary attention to this Bidding.&nbsp; Many of the
children of the different houses had been Twm&rsquo;s
school-fellows, and the pupils of his mother, which had the
effect of influencing them, and became a sort of tie, to claim
their presence at her bidding.&nbsp; As Jack&rsquo;s friends were
in Carmarthenshire, another <i>Gwahoddwr</i> was appointed by his
master to go with him to call on his at his own native place; and
so liberal was the squire on this occasion, that he sent them
both mounted on horses of their own.</p>
<p>Jack and his Bidder had no great success, as his friends
reproached him for his perverse intention of marrying a strange
woman in a far land; and finding but little pleasure in the
subject or manner of their lectures, he made a precipitate
retreat.&nbsp; Jack blushed for his countrymen, and he had
sufficient native delicacy to see that their liberality would
contrast <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>disadvantageously with the warm generosity of
Catty&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; He therefore bribed Ianto Gwyn, the
harper, who had acted as his bidder, to silence; and brought with
him to Tregaron, in a hired cart, the common contribution of a
bridegroom,&mdash;namely, a bedstead, a table, a stool, and a
dresser.&nbsp; These, he feigned had been bought with his
bidding-money, received at Carmarthen.&nbsp; Friday is always
allotted to bring home the <i>Yestavell</i>, or the woman&rsquo;s
furniture; consisting generally of an oaken coffer or chest; a
feather-bed and blankets; all the crockery and pewter; wooden
bowls, piggings, spoons, and trenchers, with the general
furniture of the shelf; but as Catty was already provided with
every thing of this kind, she had but little to add to her
stock.</p>
<p>The landlord of the public-house originally called &ldquo;The
Lion,&rdquo; but with a sign resembling a more ignoble animal,
causing it to be ultimately known by no other designation than
that of &ldquo;the cat,&rdquo; offered Jack his parlour to
receive his Cardiganshire friends in.&nbsp; Accordingly, on the
Friday before the wedding, he was busily employed in receiving
money, cheese, and butter, from them, while Catty was similarly
engaged at her residence, with <i>her</i> partizans, which were
not a few.&nbsp; This custom in Welsh is called <i>Pwrs a
Gwregys</i>, or purse and girdle; and is, doubtless, of very
remote origin.</p>
<p>At length the long-looked-for, the important Saturday arrived;
a day generally fixed upon for the celebration of the hymeneal
ordinances, in Wales, from the sage persuasion that it is a
<i>lucky day</i>, as well as for the convenience of the Sabbath
intervening between it and a working day&mdash;a glorious season
of sunshine to the children of labour.</p>
<p>Jack was agreeably disappointed to see a great many of his
Carmarthen friends had repented of their unkind treatment of his
bidder, and had now come to make amends.&nbsp; They came mounted
on their ponies, and honourably paid their <i>Pwython</i>; that
is to say, returned the presents which he or his relatives or
friends <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>had made at different weddings.&nbsp; Jack&rsquo;s
resentful and sudden disappearance, had a beneficial effect on
the feelings of his friends and countrymen; and a jealousy of
yielding the palm for liberality to a neighbouring country,
stirred a spirit of emulous contention among them, which ended in
a resolution that a party should attend the wedding, and bear
with them the <i>Pwython</i> of the others, who had an aversion
to travel such a very distant journey, being nearly five and
twenty miles, a distance in those days which was considered no
joke, but which we now, in this age of steam and locomotion,
bridge over in five and twenty minutes.</p>
<p>After depositing their offerings, and partaking of a little
refreshment, twelve of the bridegroom&rsquo;s friends, headed by
Ianto Gwyn the harper, mounted their ponies and called at
Catty&rsquo;s house, to demand the bride; and Watt the
mole-catcher and <i>Gwahoddwr</i>, who added to these functions
the father to Catty, expecting their arrival, at length heard
without appearing, the following lines, delivered by the merry
harper, from the back of his pony.</p>
<blockquote><p>Open windows, open doors,<br />
And with flowers strew the floors,<br />
Heap the hearth with blazing wood,<br />
Load the spit with festal food<br />
The <i>crochen</i> <a name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58"
class="citation">[58]</a> on its hook be placed,<br />
And tap a barrel of the best!<br />
For this is Catty&rsquo;s wedding day!<br />
Now bring the fair one out, I pray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On which Watt, with the door still closed, made this reply
without appearing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Who are ye all! ye noisy train!<br />
Be ye thieves, or honest men,<br />
Tell us now what brings you here,<br />
Or this intrusion costs you dear!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ianto Gwyn then rejoins,</p>
<blockquote><p>Honest men are we, who seek<br />
A dainty maid both fair and meek,<br />
<a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Very good
and very pretty,<br />
And known to all by name of Catty;<br />
We come to claim her for a bride;<br />
Come, father! let the pair be tied<br />
To him who loves her ever well:&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watt still within, answers;</p>
<blockquote><p>So ye say, but time will tell;<br />
My daughter&rsquo;s very well at home,<br />
So ye may pack and homeward roam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ianto Gwyn exclaims, in resolute tones,</p>
<blockquote><p>Your home no more she&rsquo;s doom&rsquo;d to
share,<br />
Like every marriageable fair,<br />
Her father&rsquo;s roof she quits for one<br />
Where she is mistress: woo&rsquo;d and won,<br />
It now remains to see her wedded,<br />
And homeward brought and safely bedded;<br />
Unless you give her up, we swear<br />
The roof from off your house to tear,<br />
Burst in the doors, and batter walls<br />
To rescue her whom wedlock calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another of the bridegroom&rsquo;s party then calls aloud, in a
voice of authority,</p>
<blockquote><p>Ho! peace in the king&rsquo;s name, here peace!<br
/>
Let vaunts and taunting language cease;<br />
While we, the bridesmen, come to sue<br />
The favour to all bridesmen due,<br />
The daughter from the father&rsquo;s hand,<br />
And entertainment kindly bland.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the great Watt, the famous entrapper of moles, with airs
mighty and grand, well befitting the dignity of the
occasion&mdash;and however absurd our English brethren may term
the custom, it is considered of serious importance with
us&mdash;throws open the door of Catty&rsquo;s dwelling, sallies
forth to give the querists a warm welcome, and as a preliminary
helps them to dismount.&nbsp; After taking a little more
refreshment, consisting of newly-baked oaten cakes, with butter
and cheese, washed down with copious draughts of ale, they all
remounted, and were joined by those of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
party; the whole rustic cavalcade making their way towards the
church.&nbsp; A motley assemblage, in truth it was, but <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>withal
picturesque, and agreeable to contemplate, for every face was
happy; save when now and then a cautious damsel, mounted behind
her father or brother, would exhibit a touch of the dismals in
the length of her features, on discovering that the <i>cwrw</i>
had any other effect but that of rendering her protector steady
in his seat on the saddle.&nbsp; Almost every sort of animal,
large or small, lame or blind, good or bad, seemed to have been
pressed into the service, and reduced to the levelling system,
and without regard to either size or quality, doomed to carry
double.</p>
<p>And thus they went on at a walking pace, while the loud chat
of many seemed drowned in the loud laughter and shouting of
others, till now and then rebuked by some of the elders; who
however, to little purpose, vociferated the words
decency&mdash;propriety&mdash;sober purposes&mdash;&amp;c.
&amp;c., the tendency of which seemed but little
understood.&nbsp; Jack, the happy bridegroom elect, bestrode a
wretched apology for a horse, whose antiquated legs trembled like
an aspen leaf; as for its bones, they were painfully apparent,
and the very curs seemed, as they looked upon this time worn
piece of cattle, to anticipate their feast.&nbsp; Elevated behind
her temporary father on a fleet horse of the squire&rsquo;s, poor
Catty was doomed to present purgatory to contrast her enjoyment
of future happiness, for, unprovided with a pillion, she sat on
the crupper, holding fast by Watt&rsquo;s coat.&nbsp; The quiet
pace which commenced this little journey was soon changed into
rough horsemanship, for the mad-cap mole-catcher turning his
steed into the Cardigan road, gave him the spur, and commenced an
outrageous gallop; the wedding party followed him with all the
might of their little beasts, and like valiant villagers in chase
of a highwayman, strove their utmost to rescue the bride.&nbsp;
Ianto Gwyn, the rural bard and harper, ever ready with an
extempore, produced on this occasion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh yes! lost, strayed, or run away<br />
This moment from the king&rsquo;s highway,<br />
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>A tall and
sightly strapping woman,<br />
A circumstance which is a rum &rsquo;un;<br />
&rsquo;Tis said a murderer of vermin<br />
On her abduction did determine;<br />
Whoe&rsquo;er will bear to gaol th&rsquo; offender,<br />
The lost one to her owner render,<br />
Shall be as handsomely rewarded,<br />
As can be readily afforded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having considerably distanced his pursuers, he stopped at
length, at Catty&rsquo;s request, who complained sadly of being
sorely bumped upon the buckle of the crupper.&nbsp; Dexterously
turning to the bye-road toward the church, he was soon perceived
and followed by the party, and altogether they soon arrived at
their journey&rsquo;s end, and alighting, they entered the sacred
fane with due decorum.&nbsp; Evans the curate, to enhance his own
services and increase his importance, took care to damp their
hilarity by keeping them waiting full three quarters of an hour,
before he made his appearance; and when he came, his looks and
demeanour partook more of the rigid priest of Saturn, than the
heart-joining, bliss-dispensing Hymen.&nbsp; His cherished plans,
which were to result in a discovery of dishonour to poor Catty,
were terribly overthrown by this decent Welsh marriage, and the
curate was in a corresponding temper.&nbsp; His nature was not
such as would rejoice at virtue triumphant, more especially as he
had calculated upon vice occupying the same position.</p>
<p>He very sternly rebuked their smiles and happy looks, and
actually threatened not to perform the marriage ceremony, until,
alarmed at the menace, they all became perfectly joyless, and
most orthodoxically gloomy.&nbsp; The indissoluble knot was soon
tied; and no longer dependent on the good offices of the
magisterial churchman, their spirit of joyousness burst forth;
while in the churchyard the mellow harp of Ianto Gwyn was playing
the sprightly air of <i>Morwynion Glan Meirionydd</i>, or the
Fair Maids of Merionethshire; while many of the party joined in
the words which belong to that beautiful and <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>animating
tune.&nbsp; Suddenly changing the air, the eccentric harper
struck up &ldquo;Megan has lost her garter,&rdquo; which was
succeeded by &ldquo;Mentra Gwen,&rdquo; and a string of such
national melodies, equally gay and appropriate.</p>
<p>After the marriage ceremony, they returned in much the same
order, or rather disorder; with the difference that the bride sat
behind her husband, instead of her father; the harper playing the
whole time, and many sweet voices joining in the words of the
airs.</p>
<p>Coming to Catty&rsquo;s house, the company found that Juggy
had been useful and hospitable.&nbsp; There was a first-rate
dinner provided, in ample proportions, of which all could and did
partake freely; every one had to pay for his own ale, but the
females, by courtesy, were &ldquo;treated&rdquo; at the expense
of males.&nbsp; In the course of the evening, jigs, reels, and
country dances, were successfully gone through with much
spirit.&nbsp; Catty danced with much agility; Jack, pressed on
all sides, and at length compelled to make one in a country
dance, showed every indication of this being his virgin attempt
at &ldquo;the poetry of motion;&rdquo; and alternately stumping
and blowing, while copious streams ran down his rugged forehead,
as they every instant corrected his erratic course, and literally
pushed him down the dance, he vowed that this his first, should
also be his last exhibition on the &ldquo;light fantastic
toe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Twm, who had been playing at sweethearts, with little
Gwenny Cadwgan on his knee, to the great mirth of his seniors,
soon brought her out to try her foot at the dance with him.&nbsp;
The poor little wench blushed scarlet deep, made her first essay
with one equally young and inexperienced with herself; and the
juvenile pair were very good-naturedly instructed in the figure
of the dance, and they contributed not a little to the general
harmony.&nbsp; Juggy, the sister of Catty, absolutely refused to
sport her figure among the dancers, and treated Watt the <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>mole-catcher
with a hard favour in the face for attempting to drag her in
perforce.&nbsp; At length, fatigued with the dancing, and alarmed
for the state of their inebriated friends and companions, many,
especially the females, turned their serious thoughts towards
home.</p>
<p>It was now drawing towards the hour of retiring for the night,
when the usual trick was played of concealing the bride from the
bridegroom.&nbsp; Poor Jack, whom nature had not favoured with a
great share of facetiousness, and who never mixed with such a
company before, began to be seriously alarmed.&nbsp; Great was
the mirth of the company, while, with a strange expression of
countenance, he sought her up and down in every corner of the
house.&nbsp; At length he discovered a part of her red petticoat
sticking out from under the bottom of the straw arm-chair, and
soon drew her out from the place of concealment.</p>
<p>The parting hour had now arrived; then came the general
shaking of hands, and serious expressions of good wishes among
the sober; while the tipsy folks vented their wit in jocular
allusions to their conjugal felicity: some offering themselves
for godfathers and godmothers to their future offspring, while
others far gone in drink, laid bets on the probability that the
first child would be either a boy or a girl.&nbsp; At this time
considerable surprise was excited by the conduct of an individual
who had been remarkably unsocial the whole evening, no person
having heard him speak a word; and when asked a question, or in
answer to a health being drank, he merely nodded in a hurried
manner, and immediately drew hard at his pipe, and puffed forth
volumes of smoke, as if to envelop himself in a cloud of
invisibility.</p>
<p>The mysterious stranger had been evidently &ldquo;taking
stock&rdquo; the whole of the evening, but whether pleased or
displeased with the proceedings did not appear, as reticence
seemed to be about the only accomplishment he possessed.&nbsp;
Every one was <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>too much engaged with their own pleasure to give him
much attention, and thus he remained till the moment of
departure, when he was observed to stagger as he rose from his
seat.&nbsp; Somebody then observed, that it must have been with
smoke and not the beer that affected his brains, as he drank but
little; a remark that imputed niggardly and curmudgeon
propensities to him.&nbsp; Determined to give him something of a
roast, a young farmer asked him, with a defying air, whether he
had paid his <i>Pwython</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; roared the hitherto silent man, &ldquo;but
here it is&mdash;take it &lsquo;Catty&rsquo; my girl, and much
good may it do thee!&rdquo;&nbsp; On which he put five golden
angels into her hand.&nbsp; With emotions of wonder and
gratitude, while catching an eager glance at his face, Catty
involuntarily exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;the squire!&rdquo; when he
darted out, mounted his horse, as did the rest of the party, rode
off, and disappeared.</p>

improves under a more able tuition.&nbsp; Watt&rsquo;s vagaries,
and the troubles and trials of a poor pedlar.&nbsp; Twm begins
his apprenticeship to a Cardiganshire farmer.</p>
<p>Determined to witness the humble festivities of the
&ldquo;lowly train,&rdquo; Squire Graspacre had been among them
the whole evening, disguised like a rough mountaineer husbandman,
and was heartily gratified, although his apparent incivility of
conduct had nearly subjected him to harsh treatment from the
jovial ale-fraught rustics, who, of course, but little relished
his strange behaviour.&nbsp; His deficiency in the Welsh language
had been concealed by alternately feigning deafness and
drunkenness, which, with the aid of the pipe left him free from
suspicion.&nbsp; The morning of Sunday after the wedding, which
is called <i>Neithior</i>, <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>being come, the happy pair stayed at
home, receiving their friends who called with their good-will,
which they manifested by the payment of <i>Pwython</i>.&nbsp; The
day was drank out, but not as in every other respect, save the
diminishing of ale, each seemed to recollect it was the Sabbath,
and tossed off their cups in quietness.</p>
<p>On Monday morning the supply of ale was exhausted, tottering
legs waggled homeward, and all was again quiet.&nbsp; Like
prudent accountants, Jack and Catty reckoned up the amount of
their wedding gifts, and found the amount to be twenty-seven
pounds eight shillings and sixpence, besides fourteen whole, and
twenty-two half cheeses, the greater part of which they soon
turned into cash.</p>
<p>In these days, when the value of money has been so much
decreased, the amount of the <i>Pwython</i>, and presents at a
Welsh wedding, have been known to reach more than treble the sum
here stated; especially when the friends of the party have been
numerous, and headed by the patronage of a wealthy and liberal
master and mistress, who generally enlist their friends and
visitors under the hymeneal banners of a faithful servant, the
architects of whose humble fortunes they become, by laying
themselves the foundation stone.</p>
<p>As, from this part of our history, the hero will rise in
importance, those who have hitherto stood forward, must
proportionably draw back, to give him due place; especially Jack
and Catty; the grand drama of whose lives has been closed by a
matrimonial union; whence, henceforth, they must sink into
inconsiderable personages.</p>
<p>In consequence of the squire&rsquo;s liberality on the
celebration of Catty&rsquo;s wedding, and a general report
prevailing that he was inclined towards the Welsh, a protector of
their customs, a general good-will towards him was manifested by
the country people.&nbsp; But his popularity reached its
culminating point when he gave forth the opinion that the Welsh
female costume was a <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>useful, elegant, and picturesque one,
and for once, a scion of John Bull became popular with us.</p>
<p>When he eulogized the Welsh harp, and gave, in addition to
various pieces of silver at different times, a golden angel to
Ianto Gwyn for his performances at Jack and Catty&rsquo;s
wedding, he gained a few steps more into their good
opinion.&nbsp; But when he declared that bed courtship should not
be abolished, there was a burst of enthusiasm in his favour in
every breast, especially among the females.&nbsp; During this new
impulse given to the reign of happiness, the great lady at the
hall and her favourite curate hid their diminished heads; the
former declaring that it was utterly impossible that the world
could last many months longer, while such immorality and
ungodliness was practiced under the auspices of a declared
patron.</p>
<p>Whether it was the influence of this alarm, or the bitterness
of baffled malignity, that preyed on her mind, certain it is, she
was soon thrown on a sick bed, and considered seriously
indisposed.&nbsp; The squire, to his honour be it said, although
unfortunately married to a very disagreeable woman, allowed a
sense of duty to supply the place of affection, when his
attentions were so indispensably needed.&nbsp; During her
illness, the worthy old rector, who had been ill but a single
week, died; and Squire Graspacre, against his own judgment and
feelings, well knowing that such an arrangement would be
agreeable to his wife, inducted the curate, Evans, into the
vacant living.&nbsp; In a fortnight after, however, she died
herself; a circumstance, perhaps, that gave no real sorrow to any
creature breathing.</p>
<p>The general report of a liberal English squire in
Cardiganshire, who patronized and upheld the customs of the
Welsh, penetrated to the extremities of the neighbouring
counties, and became at last so strangely exaggerated, that he
was represented as the patron of the learned; consequently many
of the humbler sons of the church took long journeys to be
undeceived.&nbsp; Of the many who called upon him with a view of
seeking his <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>patronage of their literary undertakings, one especially
took his fancy; a young clergyman named John David Rhys, before
named as the author of the Bidder&rsquo;s song.</p>
<p>But poetry was not his forte; his energy and perseverance in
the favourite study of Welshmen, British antiquities, and
systemizing his native language, deserved encouragement and
applause.&nbsp; He had been composing a Welsh grammar, and had
actually commenced a dictionary.&nbsp; As he spoke English very
well, the squire soon understood the merit of his undertakings,
and promised his patronage and good offices; in the mean time
requesting him to remain on the footing of a friend beneath his
roof, till something could be done for him.&nbsp; This excellent
person he now fixed upon to succeed Evans in the school and
curacy; stipulating, that for his fulfilment of the latter, he
was to have thirty pounds, and for the former ten pounds
a-year.</p>
<p>Fortunate for Rhys would it have been had the old rector
outlived the squire&rsquo;s lady, in which case it is more than
probable he would have filled the living instead of Evans, whom
the squire never liked.&nbsp; The change was a fortunate one for
Twm Shon Catty, who, as we have before seen, had already a name
for composing doggerel, and had even tried his muse in the
orthodox four-and-twenty Welsh measures.&nbsp; When he found his
new master a kind young man, an historian, antiquarian, and
something of a poet, the homage of the heart was immediately paid
him.&nbsp; Twm thought he was the wisest man in the world, when
he heard him speak of the battles fought by the Britons in
ancient times, against the Romans, Danes, and Saxons.&nbsp; This
was to him a knowledge the most estimable, and he longed to be
enabled also to talk about battles and to write patriotic
songs.&nbsp; Having now his information from a better source, he
soon learnt to despise the jargon and misstatements of Ianto
Gwyn, with whom he argued boldly, and proved to him that Geoffry
of Monmouth was a fabulist, and no historian; that it was not
Joseph of Arimathea who christianized Britain, but <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Br&acirc;n ab
Llyr, the father of renowned Caractacus, with various other such
knotty points.</p>
<p>The great deference which he paid his master, his attention to
every word which fell from his lips, with his close and
successful application to his lessons, gained him the esteem and
admiration of Rhys, with whom he became a great favourite.&nbsp;
The amiable young clergyman found much satisfaction on
discovering a youngster with taste, sufficient to appreciate his
favourite pursuits, and took pleasure in explaining to him every
subject of his enquiries.&nbsp; A thirst for information
possessed the boy; and he rummaged the most dry and tedious works
connected with Welsh antiquities, with an avidity that was
astonishing even to his master.</p>
<p>It would perhaps have been fortunate for Twm had this thirst
for study remained unchecked by any less noble desire.&nbsp; But
joking and learning, &ldquo;larks&rdquo; and Latin, practical
jests and Welsh history, are scarcely likely to agree well.&nbsp;
Watt the mole-catcher occupied his attention, and, in the end,
his acquaintance with that personage was an ill wind which blew
nobody good.</p>
<p>About eighteen months after Rhys&rsquo;s appointment to the
school, one evening in the Christmas holidays, Watt asked him if
he would take a share in a freak that would keep him up the
greater part of the night.&nbsp; Twm immediately assented,
without enquiring its nature; enough for him it was that it was a
scheme of merry mischief, in the prospect of which his heart ever
bounded.</p>
<p>This idle whim of Watt&rsquo;s was nothing more than to pull
down the signs of all the public-houses and shops; which being
few, was easily done, but the greater difficulty was to suspend
them from, or attach them to, the tenements of others, in which
they however succeeded.&nbsp; This trick elicited some humour;
and a satirical application was discernible in the new disposal
of the boards.&nbsp; When the light of day discovered their
handy-work, great was the astonishment of the ale-house-keepers
<a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>and
others, to find their signs vanished, and gracing the fronts of
their neighbours&rsquo; private houses; and the anger of the
reverend Inco Evans was boundless, on perceiving the &ldquo;Fox
and Goose&rdquo; over the rectory house door, with the words
proceeding from the mouth of reynard, &ldquo;I have thee
now;&rdquo; and under the pictorial figures &ldquo;Good
entertainment for man or horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A crowd was in consequence collected about his door, and the
provoking laughter of the people stung him to the bitterest
degree of resentment.&nbsp; A most unlucky old carl of a Scotch
pedlar at this moment very innocently entered the house, taking
it, as the sign imported, for a tavern, and unstrapping his huge
pack, laid it on the clerical magistrate&rsquo;s table, calling
about, &ldquo;hollow! Fox and Goose;&rdquo; on which the reverend
host and his spouse appeared, she laughing at the jest, and he
frowning with the aspect of a demon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ye &rsquo;re come,&rdquo; said the facetious Scot,
&ldquo;by my saul aw never kenn&rsquo;d twa that looked the
characters sa weal afore&mdash;a merry guse an a sour fox! come
gi us a pot of your best half and half.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lady ran
out laughing, but Inco sourly answered, &ldquo;O yes! friend,
thou shalt have half and half to thy heart&rsquo;s
content;&rdquo; and turning his back, shut and locked the door,
leaving the poor pedlar in gaping wonderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re an aufu&rsquo; time coming!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;se warrant they&rsquo;re brewing the beer.&nbsp; Hech,
sirs, this is a strange place o&rsquo; ca&rsquo;, and they
wouldna&rsquo; find sic a vile &rsquo;yun, frae John
o&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s to John o&rsquo;
Aberdeen&rsquo;s!&rdquo;&nbsp; But his rumination on the subject
was cut short by the return of Inco, who unlocking the door, was
followed in by two serving damsels, each bearing a pewter vase
containing something less fragrant than the sweets of Araby,
which they duly discharged in the face of the unconscious pedlar,
accompanied with Inco&rsquo;s exclamation &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
half and half for you!&rdquo; and the girls retreated in roars of
laughter, while their poor victim cursed them for vile nanny
goats of the mountains.</p>
<p>At this moment young Twm, humanely feeling for the
stranger&rsquo;s ill treatment, informed him of his error <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>in mistaking
that house, the residence of the clergyman and magistrate of the
town, for a tavern.&nbsp; Adding that be feared the constables
were sent for, to put him in the stocks.&nbsp; It need scarcely
be added, that Sawney was soon many miles away from
Tregaron.&nbsp; Hop-o-my-Thumb never used his legs and his
seven-leagued boots to such express purpose as did Sawney, for he
pushed on as though he knew terrors were behind, and the safety
of the body depended upon the speed of his legs.&nbsp; Squire
Graspacre from indolence or dislike to all business except
farming, declined being in the commission of the peace himself,
and put the parson in his stead.&nbsp; Having now attained the
summit of his ambition, as rector and justice of the peace, his
overweening presumption and conceit became daily more
conspicuous; and therefore this slur upon his consequence was
intolerable.&nbsp; The actor in this simple freak became at
length known in consequence of the secret being intrusted, a very
common case, to a <i>confidential friend</i>.</p>
<p>Although the twenty shillings reward which the parson offered
could not induce the poorest to be base enough to become an
informer, yet an idle spirit of tattling among the women brought
it at length to the ears of Mistress Evans, and her husband soon
became possessed of the whole particulars.&nbsp; He instantly
made his complaint to the squire against both Twm and Watt, who
were merely reprimanded, cautioned for the future, and
dismissed.</p>
<p>The circumstances under which Twm Shon Catty was educated, now
suddenly occurred to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What the goodness is to
become of that young imp of mischief?&rdquo; said he, one day, to
Rhys the curate, whom he had informed of the particulars of the
birth, and his deceased wife&rsquo;s whim of having him well
educated, in consequence of him being a slip of Sir John
Wynn&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That connection being entirely closed by the
death of his wife, he no longer felt himself bound or inclined to
notice him.&nbsp; When Rhys gave so good an account of his
proficiency, he was surprised to hear the squire <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>exclaim&mdash;&ldquo;I am sorry for it, for he has no
prospect in the world but labour and beggary.&nbsp; As he had
already had too good an education for his circumstances, he must
be instantly dismissed from the school.&nbsp; Since Sir John does
not think proper to protect his son, I don&rsquo;t see why I
should.&nbsp; As the poet very properly says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Too much learning makes a man a fool;<br />
I&rsquo;d have no lad attend too long at school:<br />
Give him a taste, then turn him out adrift;<br />
In knowledge, at the least, he&rsquo;s had a lift.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twm and his master parted with mutual regret, for latterly
they were more like companions than master and scholar; and the
generous Rhys could not restrain a tear on beholding a youth of
so much promise destined to the uncertain wilderness of a hard
and cold world, especially after having evinced a superiority of
taste and intellect, that under favourable auspices would have
entitled him to shine and flourish in his day.&nbsp; Twm remained
awhile at his mother&rsquo;s, a big boy of fifteen, idling away
his days without any view to the future.&nbsp; Greatly concerned
on his account and her own inability to support him, Catty went
one day to the squire, and implored him to do something for her
son; and he at last <i>generously</i> decided to send him as a
parish apprentice to a farmer, whose grounds were situate in the
neighbouring mountains.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">The</span> family of the
Welsh farmer.&nbsp; Not a bright look-out for our hero.</p>
<p>Morris Greeg, the farmer to whom the parish had consigned our
hero, as an apprentice, possessed a small freehold farm, fourteen
miles up the mountain; and thither, in the company or custody of
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Watt the
mole-catcher, Twm was now marched.&nbsp; Dull and joyless was
their journey, unenlivened either by incident or the charms of
scenery.&nbsp; On their arrival at the destined spot, Twm could
scarcely forbear shuddering at the prospect before him.&nbsp; The
farm-house was a low long building, under the same roof as the
cow-house and stable, and as the whole was covered with a black
mass of rotten thatch, composed of varied patches of
half-perished straw and fern, the only signs of its being
inhabited by humanity were a chimney, with two or three farm
implements lying at the hovel door.</p>
<p>The farm, called Cwm y Gwarm Ddu, (Black marsh dingle,) was
abbreviated usually to Gwern Ddu; the latter word, be it known to
our English readers, is pronounced <i>Thee</i>.&nbsp; The land of
which it was composed, had been anciently cribbed from the
mountain, according to the Havod un-n&ocirc;s <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a> system.&nbsp; Being too remote from any
other settlements to be noticed by any of the parishioners but
the shepherds, who were bribed to silence by occasional
refreshment as they passed that way, the appropriation remained
long unquestioned.&nbsp; And when of later years some of the
nearest farmers became troublesome busy-bodies on the occasion, a
few days&rsquo; labour given gratis in harvest time by Morris
Greeg&rsquo;s grandfather and father, made all quiet again, till
latterly, the farm of Gwern Ddu became incontestably a freehold
property.</p>
<p>Twm felt no great wonder that its existence, as narrated by
Watt, remained so long unknown, and wished an earthquake had been
so good as to swallow it before he had been destined to enter its
precincts.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;It was in sooth a landscape harsh.<br />
On one side rock, and three sides marsh:<br />
With naught to please the restless eye,<br />
A scene to cause a weary sigh.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The farm occupied one side of a dreary dingle, being one
field&rsquo;s breadth only from the rocky mountain above, and
divided from a swampy turbary marsh by a roaring torrent-like
brook.&nbsp; The house and the farm appertainments, with a view
to shelter at the expense of a healthier foundation, were
situated on the marsh-side of the brook, the waters of which were
crossed by a rustic bridge formed of a fallen tree, that led
towards the fields, and by a short lane and a path through the
wood, to the mountain above them.&nbsp; Instead of the hawthorn,
willow, birch, and the nut-bearing pleasant hazel, that usually
form the hedges in more favoured lands, these poor little fields
had their boundary ditches surmounted by that rude bantling of
barrenness, the prickly gorse, more poetically called the
yellow-blossomed furze; intermingled here and there, as in the
adjoining mountain, with its brunette sister, the
purple-flowering heath, immortalized in Scottish literature as
the mountain heather.</p>
<p>Above the rustic bridge, the bright pure water, yet unpolluted
by the touch of man, rolled in a small cascade over the smooth
black rock, contrasting by its foaming whiteness, with the sable
bed from which it sprung.&nbsp; This little water-fall was
called&mdash;Y Pistyll, or the spout; from which was obtained the
water destined for household uses.&nbsp; From its side the farm
lasses scooped the gravel wherewith they scoured their
milk-pails, hoops and staves, rivalling by their whiteness, the
nectarious stream within.&nbsp; Below the bridge, the brook had
been widened by human art, so as to form a considerable pool,
wherein the aquatic members of the farm-yard, the stately silent
geese and the noisy ducks, at times floated gravely, with their
young yellow brood, at others, ploughing and gambolling merrily
and undisturbed; save when the horses, cows, or oxen were driven
across; for the <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>upper part of the pool formed part of the regular
road.</p>
<p>Through this wood, ran an oblique path, that after turning the
corner of an angular rising whose upper end was bounded by a
terrific precipice of no less than ninety feet perpendicular
height, and known by the name of Allt y Craig Llwyd, or
Acclivious Forest of the Grey Rock, which indicated that trees at
some period clothed the scene now defaced by hideous
nakedness.&nbsp; On winding round and gaining the summit of the
peak above this quarry, an extensive tract of level mountain
appeared in one direction; in another, the dreary monotony was
broken by the appearance of petty lakes or mountain pools, on
which floated at times certain families of migratory aquatic
birds, that here made their temporary resting place, in their
hasty journeys to more favoured regions.&nbsp; Ravines, and
caves, the reputed bed-chambers of evil spirits, long-maned
unbroken horses, and numerous flocks of wild-looking small sheep,
were the other objects that diversified the scene; and the
horizon was closed by the distant mountain peaks, one above
another, wildly strange, but most grandly clustered.</p>
<p>On Watt&rsquo;s presenting Twm to a tall, gaunt, swarthy-faced
man, who proved to be Morris Greeg himself, as the apprentice
which the parish had sent him, his brows contracted, and his
sunken eyes threw out their fires in a flash of indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried the old man, after eyeing our hero
with the contempt which a sordid clown might evince towards a
puny insect, as he wondered, in the dulness of his conception,
why heaven should trouble itself in creating a thing incapable of
hewing wood or carrying burdens&mdash;&ldquo;a pretty help they
have sent me truly!&nbsp; Of what service will a weak creature
like this be to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None!&rdquo; screamed a thin hag of a yellow-faced
woman, &ldquo;but to eat up all the victuals; I warrant, by his
thin carcass and long crane neck, that he has the stomach of a
hound.&nbsp; This neck looks as if it had <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>been
stretched already.&nbsp; But if it hasn&rsquo;t, it soon will be
by the looks of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four damsels, the daughters of the house, now made their
appearance, and scrutinized our hero over each other&rsquo;s
shoulder, as if he had been a reptile of some unquestionable
species, whom it was not safe to approach too near.&nbsp; A
sturdy ploughman in a white frock sat at the table, silently, but
sullenly, descanting on the merits of the food before him, by
alternately sneering and masticating what appeared to be more
necessary to his stomach than agreeable to his palate.&nbsp; On
the left of the ploughman sat a singular-looking thin
parrot-nosed boy, the only one that appeared to greet him with a
look of welcome; his small black eyes actually laughed with
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Moses, thou hast now a companion to help thee to
devour food, and do nothing,&rdquo; said farmer Greeg, as he
motioned to Watt and Twm to sit and eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thee hast now a companion to help thee to eat and
do nothing,&rdquo; repeated the farmer&rsquo;s eldest daughter
Shaan, whose habit it was to echo all the sayings of her father
and mother, so as to publish herself as one of the authorities of
the house.&nbsp; Moses said nothing audibly, but a rueful
expression of countenance gave it the lie to the insinuation most
pointedly, and Twm fancied that he brushed away a tear with his
sleeve, as he rose hastily and walked out of the house.</p>
<p>Watt had been busy &ldquo;taking stock&rdquo; of the
ploughman&rsquo;s countenance; a compliment apparently by no
means appreciated by the object of his regard.&nbsp; The
ploughman hastily finished his dinner, and was about to beat a
retreat, when Watt enquired, &ldquo;Is&rsquo;nt thy name Abel
Prosser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Shaan, &ldquo;what does thou deny thy
name for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I have a warrant against thee, as the runaway
father of Palley Bais Wen&rsquo;s bantling,&rdquo; cried Watt;
&ldquo;help to secure him in the king&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>The man
made a dart from the house, and Watt after him.&nbsp; The event
of the chase remained long unknown as neither were seen again by
the present party for many a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil take that Watt Gwathotwr!&rdquo; screamed
Sheeny Greeg the farmer&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;for he brings us
nothing but trouble.&nbsp; Two years ago he brought us this
Moses, the deserted bantling of a rascally Jew, who deceived the
silly wench of a hedge-ale-house maid, where he lodged; and now
he has brought another of no more strength than a grey-hound
puppy; and worse than all, he has scared away Abel Prosser.&nbsp;
What are we to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; cried Shaan scornfully, &ldquo;we shall do
very well; make these two fellows do Abel&rsquo;s work, and their
own.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this very comfortable prospect before him,
Twm went to rest with the Jew boy in the hay-loft, this first
night after his arrival in the alpine region of Cwmny Gwern
Ddu.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Moses</span> has many
youthful yearnings.&nbsp; The exploits of the lads in fasting and
feasting.</p>
<p>Some say it is a comfort to have a brother in affliction,
visited by similar trials, and persecuted rigour.&nbsp; Now Moses
and Twm could be sympathetic enough, for they had to endure
labour enough and too much, but quite the opposite quantity of
eatables; they, therefore, in their misery, became firm and
attached companions.&nbsp; Twm at first found much to disgust him
with his fellow sufferer, as he seemed disposed to talk of
nothing but culinary matters; the roast and boiled, the stewed,
the fried, were his darling topics.&nbsp; When Twm dilated on
some of the festal doings at Graspacre-hall, the prematurely
sunken eyes <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>of this wretched starveling would glisten with a lambent
flame that threatened the immediate extinction of his senses, he
exclaimed, &ldquo;O Lord, how I should like to make one of
them!&mdash;I heard a strange man once talk of an ox being
roasted whole&mdash;can such a thing be? what a&mdash;what a
sight!&nbsp; O Lord, how I should like to tear two, three, four,
hot ribs out of a roasting ox&mdash;I would get into the carcass,
and roast with it, so that I might tug, tear, and eat my fill
first.&nbsp; If I knew my way to any great town from this awful
place, I&rsquo;ll tell thee Twm, how I should like to get my
living&mdash;I would eat for wagers&mdash;I have heard of such
doings, and I know I could die contented, if I had once my
stomach full of flesh&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; I would tear it,
and ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; Oh! how I would tear and swallow
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm felt horror-struck to hear these frantic ravings of this
poor famished being, his eyes starting from their sockets, and
his thin talon-like hands clutching vacantly at imaginary
food.&nbsp; He strove to comfort him with future hopes, but the
wretch had now sunk into a fit of weeping despondency, and as the
tears ran down his young emaciated face, he exclaimed, in a tone
of utter hopelessness, &ldquo;no, no, I shall sleep on these
mountains, and never have my fill of any thing but work and
sorrow, work and sorrow till I die!&rdquo;&nbsp; Suddenly
starting from his reclining posture to his feet, and as suddenly
changing his querulous tones to those of maniac rapture that was
alarming from the startling transition&mdash;&ldquo;Canst thee
eat raw eggs, Twm?&nbsp; I have a store of them hid away in the
barn&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have a feast of them to-night,
boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Previous to this scene, they had been thrashing together till
over fatigued they sat themselves down on the straw.&nbsp; The
silence of their flails informed the quick ears of old Sheeny of
this pause in their labour.&nbsp; Hastening with stealthy steps
towards the barn, she unluckily arrived the moment when Moses
vaunted of the intended feast of eggs.&nbsp; With the soundless
steps and savage purpose of the taloned cat, that marks the
moment to dart upon the heedless bird, she reached over <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the latch;
unlatching it, she burst into the middle of the barn, and seizing
the first flail in her way, she vowed with a tremendous oath to
break every bone in his body with it unless the eggs were
immediately produced.&nbsp; As she had once broke his leg, which
Evans the blacksmith had imperfectly set for him, poor Moses made
a virtue of necessity, and at once took her to his little
hoard.&nbsp; Poor lad; it was like drawing his blood, to take
away this prospect of a feed, and his eyes filled with tears as
Sheeny gathered them all in her apron and marched off
triumphantly.&nbsp; The loss of the eggs, valuable as they were
in their hungry circumstances, was trivial to the daily
annoyances of the female tongues that trimmed and stung them both
within and without doors for many a day after, on this
subject.</p>
<p>Old Sheeny was certainly a notable manager, an economist to
the back bone.&nbsp; Abstemious moralists, those excellent
friends of the human race, have declared, that the new-fangled
improvements in modern cookery have inclined mankind to devour
twice the quantity of food requisite or beneficial for the health
and happiness of our species.&nbsp; Sheeny Greeg, the careful
mistress of this mountain mansion, had no idea of inflicting such
an evil on those favoured beings confided to her
protection.&nbsp; Therefore, in a pure philosophic spirit, as an
antidote to gluttony and intemperance, she took care, like an
ancient Spartan dame, that the food and drink of her providing
should be neither too rich nor too savory.&nbsp; Consequently
gout and plethora were never found among the maladies of her
inmates.&nbsp; She had an admirable contrivance that did honour
to her inventive powers, of substituting durability for the
dangerous quality of palatableness, in the food she
administered.</p>
<p>For instance, in the article of bread, her custom was to bake
an enormous batch at once; so that it soon got hard, musty and
mouldy, it must be admitted that the temptation to gluttonize on
it and its accompaniments, was diminished.&nbsp; In preparing
that standing dish of the Welsh farm, the flummery, <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>she would
steep for a considerable time, a large portion of the oaten
commodity for that purpose, till thoroughly soured to the acidity
of crab-juice.&nbsp; The skim milk, in which this mess was
soused, she considered as too gross for their unsophisticated
stomachs, till diluted with the pure element from the brook.</p>
<p>The whey and butter-milk underwent the same process; and the
cheese kept for home consumption was manufactured of that
fang-defying, heart of oak, sort of toughness, which answers the
patriotic purpose of cannon-balls, to repel invaders, should
their cupidity ever be inflamed by the reported felicities of
Cwmny Gwern Ddu: in which alarming supposition it is some
satisfaction to reflect, as a point to our moral, that the crime
would carry the punishment along with it.&nbsp; Whenever those
rare and almost denounced strangers to the table, the beef or
bacon made their appearance, the greedy fangs that seized them
would suddenly relax their tenacious grip, like the blind dog
that mistook a red-hot poker for a bone, in evident alarm, lest a
portion of Lot&rsquo;s wife had accidentally fallen in their way;
a cannibal impression that seemed to haunt them long after, till
washed away by many a copious draught of the fluid that cost
nothing.&nbsp; Morris Greeg himself was a fine example to his
household, as a scorner of unnecessary dainties.&nbsp; Doubtless
it was very edifying to Twm and Moses, to hear him descant on the
enormities of gross feeding, enlivened by anecdotes of people who
had eaten themselves to death.</p>
<p>He would tell tales about the dreadful troubles brought upon a
man by being over fat&mdash;obesity was, to hear him, a state of
existence only equalled in horror by the pains and penalties of
the lower regions.&nbsp; He narrated a veritable instance of a
Daniel Lambert, who got so fat, and so immovable, that he rolled
himself into a large trough of water, and voluntarily died the
death of a suicide.&nbsp; Moses, the young infidel, would gape
incredulously at such an intimation, <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and evidently doubted the probability
of such a death; and if it were possible, impious cormorant as he
was, he would have no objection to martyrdom on such a score.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plain food, and as little of it as possible,&rdquo;
quoth Morris, &ldquo;is a fine thing,&rdquo; grinding as he spoke
a mass of black-eyed winter-dried beans with rusty bacon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And leaven,&rdquo; cried the sage of the mountains,
&ldquo;is far better in the bread than barn; it warms the stomach
with its generous acid, and makes me content with
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero, however, had a bold heart; and if a little better
fed, would have endured all with that indifference and vein of
whim which were natural to him.&nbsp; As it was, with the wild
companionship of Moses, he turned misery herself into a scarecrow
of mirth rather than of terror.&nbsp; Together those
mischievously merry boys dispatched their breakfasts of highly
watered milk and porridge, thickened with mouldy bread, with
hungry yet loathing stomachs, and indulged in under currents of
laughter, as either of them aped some peculiarity of gait or
visage in their amiable hostess.</p>
<p>And when the rusty bacon liquor was enlarged for repeated
messes of broth, their wry faces gave indications of their inmost
feelings, whilst the latter manifested themselves by a waterspout
movement generally supposed to indicate disquietude of the
stomach.&nbsp; Their patience was severely tried; often when they
felt a conviction that this species of drenching was over, they
had the unexpected mortification to find a quantity of water
added, to spin it out for another meal.&nbsp; This was truly a
sad change to Twm, compelled as he was daily to embrace his
antipathies, and disconnect himself from all that he had learned
to love.&nbsp; He loved ballad lore, rural festivities, rambling,
and all those light modes of passing his time that were most
allied to idleness.</p>
<p>But in this dreary house, not a book was to be seen nor the
sound of mirth, harp, or song, ever heard; still Twm did not
despond; his good humour had <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>the effect of brightening, by many a
shade, the desponding apprehensions of Moses; and more than once
he actually won a smile from one or two of the younger daughters
of the house, who, however, soon rebuked themselves for
descending to be pleased with anything that a parish apprentice
boy could advance.</p>
<p>In the long winter evenings, when no one could possibly invent
a task or job for them, Twm and Moses would be allowed to sit a
little by the turf fire; when the latter would venture to narrate
some hungry tale of gastronomic heroism, in which his fancy
revelled, Twm would recite ghost stories that terrified the
damsels; and war tales of olden times that he had heard from
Ianto Gwyn, or his master, Rhys, that astonished and amused his
auditors, at least part of them, for Sheeny Greeg and her echo
Shaan disdained to be among the number, but cried shame on him
for repeating such audacious lies.</p>
<p>Miserly people often overshoot their mark, and it was so in
this farm-house.&nbsp; Old Elwes would have called Morris Greeg a
worthy disciple, whilst other misers of even greater note would
have looked upon the farm-house and its ways as the very acme of
human felicity.&nbsp; But &ldquo;greed&rdquo; begets greater
evils; and when Morris was by chance called away, the girls
indulged themselves in the best way they could find.&nbsp; Theft
was largely patronized, and as we should charitably think not
without very reasonable excuse.&nbsp; One fair, day when Morris
and Sheeny had betaken themselves to a distant corn and cattle
mart, the girls, as usual, commenced their preparation for a
regular junketing.&nbsp; Twm and Moses, whom they kept at the
humble distance of lowly menials, were out together, mending some
gaps in the hedges, when Moses sniffing the wind that blew from
the direction of the house, with the gifted nose of a dog of the
chase, called out with ecstacy, &ldquo;Twm, I smell
pan-cake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, Moses,&rdquo; returned our little hero,
expanding his nostrils with jocular comicality, &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;
cried Moses, with an envious snarl, &ldquo;The selfish wenches <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>of the house
are treating their dainty chops with something nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; retorted Twm, quoting from some learned
Theban, &ldquo;when the cat&rsquo;s away the mice will
play.&nbsp; But stop thee here, Moses, and see if I don&rsquo;t
bring thee a share of what is going, in five
minutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moses grinned and licked his lips in eager
anticipation as Twm hurried off.&nbsp; He entered the house with
a sudden startling step, and a bundle of firewood under his arm
as an excuse for the intrusion.&nbsp; All was panic within an
instant.&nbsp; Two of the girls dashed their jug of sweetened
small beer into the pail of hog&rsquo;s wash, as they heard the
first rattle of the wooden latch on Twm&rsquo;s entrance; Shaan
turned pale as the unfried pancake before her, so great was their
fear that their parents had returned in the midst of their
underhand clandestine doings.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is only that devil
Twm Shon Catty,&rdquo; cried Shaan, who was the first to recover
from the general terror; &ldquo;Never mind, girls, go and sweeten
more beer, for father and mother can&rsquo;t be home before
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, go and sweeten more beer, and let poor Moses and I
have a share of your beer and pancakes,&rdquo; cried Twm,
pointedly eyeing a raised heap of them in a wooden platter before
the fire;&mdash;&ldquo;let <i>us</i> have a part, and we
won&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get along to thy work, thou saucy cur!&rdquo; cried
Shaan, striking him with all her strength with the hot
frying-pan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not till I have our share to take with
me,&rdquo; cried our hero, making a grasping snatch at the heaped
pancakes, which he bore off in spite of the united efforts of the
lasses to re-capture them.&nbsp; His manner of bestowing them was
more commendable on the score of security than of delicacy, as
the greater portion was thrust into his shirt-breast and breeches
pockets; off he ran over the wooden bridge and along the path
through the wood.</p>
<p>In this chase the great heat against his breast gave him
considerable pain, and almost arrested his steps, half persuaded
to throw away the larded delicacy; St. <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>Vitus never danced faster nor more
spasmodically under his pains, than did our hero under the
effects of his hot pancakes.&nbsp; They gave him shocks equal in
intensity to those from the voltaic pile; in fact he may be said
to have been a Salamander enduring the scorchings of heat, but
with this difference.&mdash;Twm Shon Catty could not well bear
them, whereas the Salamander was represented as rather enjoying
them than otherwise.</p>
<p>But, like the Spartan boy, Twm heroically determined to bear
the self-inflicted torture, and endure to the last.&nbsp;
However, it must be confessed, to the minoration of his fame,
that not having been favoured with so stoical an education as the
aforesaid Lacedemonian, he yielded to nature, and ran and roared,
and roared and ran, till he outran his pursuers, who returned
breathless home, and he as breathless joined young Moses, where,
in their secret haunt, they enjoyed the fruit of his
dexterity.</p>
<p>The spot they occupied was one of the discoveries of Moses,
before Twm&rsquo;s arrival, the craggy recesses of which became
the depositaries of his filching achievements, and which
recurring to in after years, he called his larder.&nbsp; It was
situated above the torrent, beside the mountain, at the extreme
end of the farm&mdash;just where the wilderness had refused to
yield another patch to add to former accumulation.&nbsp; But
these gormandizing youths were at present too busily engaged to
remark on either the beauties or the horrors of the scene.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Studies</span> piscatorial
and fleshy, and certain tricks connected therewith.&nbsp; Pork
capers&mdash;a new dish.</p>
<p>Emboldened by the impunity with which they had foraged for
themselves during the last three months that had followed the
doings in our last chapter, both Twm and Moses grew somewhat
daring in their gastronomical speculations.&nbsp; Moses, among
his restless peerings for something to gratify appetite, had
peeped into one of the mountain pools, and joyfully detected the
existence of a certain sizeable fish there.&nbsp; This was a
discovery which made the young Jew&rsquo;s mouth water, and his
eyes distend with visions of future work for the jaws!&nbsp; Here
was an El Dorado of good food, and Moses went into proportionate
rapture at the prospect.&nbsp; Twm annoyed him not a little, by
laughing at his futile attempts to spear a pike with the dull and
clumsy prongs of a dungfork.</p>
<p>Our hero was more successful in his warfare on the trout and
eels that abounded in a brook which ran through one of the
tarns.&nbsp; Without any contrivance that resembled
fishing-tackle in the most remote degree, he remarked a sweeping
curve, of a horse-shoe shape, in one part of the brook, and
determined, with the assistance of Moses, on sporting his
engineering skill, in cutting a new channel for the water, so
that it might for the future, run a straight course, and leave
the horseshoe portion of it dry.&nbsp; This at different
intervals, with no small labour, they at last effected; and when
the flood ran along the new channel, its deserted curve became a
mess of slimy mud.&nbsp; Into this, with naked feet, they soon
waded, and groping cautiously about, succeeded in gathering an
abundant harvest of trout and eels.&nbsp; Moses was noisy in his
raptures at the result, and so anxious to have them immediately
cooked, that he could scarcely wait for that tedious
progress.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>However, they soon kindled a fire by rubbing together
some rotten wood, and with the aid of some dry turf, the quarry
under the precipice of Allt y Craig became a temporary heath of
blazing beauty.&nbsp; Utterly void of any culinary utensils, they
resolved on the primitive mode of broiling their fish on hot
stones, and Moses, all alacrity, proceeded on the task of
preparing them.</p>
<p>But, alas, for the sequel of their adventure!&nbsp; Before
they could realize their project, the dark countenance of Morris
Greeg paralyzed their efforts, as the serpent&rsquo;s gaze is
said to fascinate its victim.&nbsp; The angry farmer gruffly
demanded where they had been, how they had dared to idle away
their time, and what was the meaning of that wasteful fire
against the rock.&nbsp; The ready lie, or presence of mind as it
is favourably called, of Twm and Moses soon supplied answers,
such as they were.&nbsp; Twm said, that hearing the good woman of
the house complain of a visit from the old enemy the cholic, he
determined to catch a dish of fish for her, to drive it away,
pointing triumphantly to his piscatory store; thus beating a
retreat with all the diplomacy and tact of a good general, who
when he finds he cannot obtain a victory, at any rate manages to
gain credit for a wise &lsquo;retrograde.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Moses followed up Twm&rsquo;s assertion by declaring that the
fire was to frighten away the crows and the kites that might take
fancy to the young lambs, or the wheat in the neighbouring field;
a manifestation of care over his master&rsquo;s property, which
had, at any rate, the claim of originality to back it.&nbsp;
Morris was as great an economist of his words as in matters of
worldly goods, and therefore, whatever he thought, he did not
waste breath with reply; but suddenly ordered Moses to carry the
fish into the house, and Twm to give some hay to the cows.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And be sure,&rdquo; quoth the careful farmer, &ldquo;that
you give most hay to the cow that gives most milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be sure of it!&rdquo; replied Twm pointedly, and
with sulky asperity.&nbsp; The next moment, to the great <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>astonishment,
and greater anger of Morris Greeg, he threw as much hay as his
two arms could embrace, under the water-spout.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; cried the redoubted son of Catty,
&ldquo;that is the cow which gives me most milk, for that cursed
broth and porridge is almost wholly made from this never-failing
animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A precipitous retreat of course, followed this explanation,
and Morris Greeg was left alone to chew the cud of his
resentment.&nbsp; At dinner the next day, the wrath of Morris
having evaporated, all grew smooth again.&nbsp; While Twm and
Moses bolted their insipid mess of dovery, otherwise called
burgoo, the gratification was rather questionable in having as
their share merely the smell of the fried fish, on which Sheeny
and Shaan with the younger daughters were regaling, and praising
the flavour at every mouthful they swallowed.&nbsp; Moses ground
his teeth, and would have impaled them in the excess of his rage,
for the loss of his expected feast.&nbsp; Twm said nothing, but
inwardly resolved on faring better, and that very speedily.&nbsp;
Shaan grinned like a hyena as she treated her dainty gums with
fish after fish, and spitefully enjoyed their mortification, as
she whispered to Twm, &ldquo;now we are even for the
pancakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at the finishing of this mid-day meal, the barking of a
strange dog drew Twm and Moses out to the yard.&nbsp; There they
saw a half-starved cur, belonging to a cottager who was cutting
turf in the adjoining turbary.&nbsp; This wretched animal,
evidently a cut-throat leveller in principle, was disputing with
one of the pigs his right to engross the whole trough to himself,
which the bristly conservative at length resented by snapping in
two one of the hind legs of his canine enemy.</p>
<p>The dog set up a dismal howl as a requiem for the loss of the
fourth part of his understanding, which was soon silenced by
Moses striking him on the head with a large stone, which killed
him on the spot.&nbsp; The cottager hurried home, frightened by
Twm, who told him would be sued for the damages done by his
dog.&nbsp; Our hero, with the assistance of Moses, to whom he <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>imparted the
scheme he had now in hand, immediately bathed the buttocks of the
pig with the dog&rsquo;s blood; and then pouring some dry sand in
his ear, drove him howling down the yard.&nbsp; Annoyed with the
freedom thus taken with his auricular organ, the offended
gentleman of the sty rushed to and fro, at a rate as violent as
some of his celebrated ancestors, when they sought to drown both
themselves and the devils within them in the sea.&nbsp; Morris
lifted his hands amidst the assembled household, and ruefully
exclaimed, &ldquo;the devil is in the pig!&rdquo;&nbsp; His
gambols were certainly most extraordinary, and far surpassed the
evolutions&rsquo; of the bull&rsquo;s frisky wife, commonly
called the cow&rsquo;s courante.&nbsp; He sometimes aimed to
stand on his hind legs, to emulate the figure, intimating in
pantomime, &ldquo;I am as good a man as the best of
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While in this position, he would toss his head as loftily as
an envious beauty that heard her rival praised; and then, as if
to evince his unrivalled versatility, he aimed to reverse his
position, and stand on his head.</p>
<p>Thus did he enliven the farm-yard, and cut sundry unusual
capers, not at all in keeping with the hitherto grave tenor of
all his modest life; at which Morris was scandalized, the women
astonished, and the two mischievous imps that caused this
torture, amused as if a party of mountebanks had exhibited before
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such things have been in the days of
old,&rdquo; cried Morris, with a pious whine, &ldquo;the pig is
possessed of a devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a legion of devils!&rdquo; screamed Sheeny and
Shaan, in the utmost alarm; &ldquo;the pig is mad!&rdquo; cried
Moses; &ldquo;the dog was mad that bit the pig!&rdquo; cried
Twm.&nbsp; This remark, which assigned a natural cause for the
frisky gambols of the tortured grunter, had the effect of
sobering every one from their wild supernatural speculations, to
the no less alarming fact that poor porker was the victim of
hydrophobia.&nbsp; Morris all at once turned pious, and remarked
that &ldquo;this might be <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>one of the signs which were to
precede the end of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; whispered Twm to Moses, &ldquo;it is a sign
which certainly precedes the end of the pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Convinced by the reiteration of Twm and Moses, that the pig
was really stark staring maliciously and mischievously mad,
Morris seemed more grieved at his prospect of worldly loss in so
much hog&rsquo;s flesh, than as if his first suggestion had been
verified about the dissolution of the world.&nbsp; He
pathetically lamented the loss it would be, to kill him before he
was duly fattened.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must be killed and eaten
fresh,&rdquo; whined Morris, &ldquo;as he is too lean to be
salted and baconed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall be killed and buried like a dog!&rdquo; cried
Sheeny, &ldquo;or we shall all be maddened and biting one
another, if we swallow a bit of him, fat or lean&mdash;Oh! the
pity to lose this precious griskin!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t eat mad pork!&rdquo; cried Shaan; &ldquo;nor
I,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;nor I!&rdquo; cried the younger lasses,
deeply horrified at the idea of being smothered between two
feather-beds, which Twm assured them, with a very grave and
serious face, was an easy and comfortable death, and such as was
always allotted by law to those who got mad by the bite of a mad
dog, or by eating what was venomed by his bite.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will never touch a bit of him,&rdquo; cried all the girls at
once; &ldquo;but I will!&rdquo; muttered both Twm and Moses, to
themselves, glowing with the thought of future feasting.</p>
<p>Morris in the deepest tribulation pondered on the perversity
of his household, and at last decided on waiting till next
morning before he would give his ultimatum as to how the pig was
to be disposed of, in the meantime locking him up in a
stable.&nbsp; It was a night of trial for Morris.&nbsp; To lose
an entire porker at one fell swoop, and the household to be so
very unaccommodating as not to eat him, was a really serious
thing.&nbsp; He mentally prayed for the renewed health on the
part of the pig, or else that some kind pig-drover would fall
from the clouds and be the saving angel of him.&nbsp; The said
Morris Greeg&rsquo;s conscience <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>did not see further than his own
acts.&nbsp; If the imaginary drover bought the pig, and others
were made mad, why it was none of Morris&rsquo;s concern.&nbsp;
So much for his refined morality.&nbsp; Thus he comforted himself
by reflecting, that whoever got mad with eating him, that was
<i>their</i> concern, not <i>his</i>; as it would be unbecoming
in him to dictate to others what they were to buy or to
eat.&nbsp; And as to mentioning his faults, as some unreasonable
readers require, he defied any one to prove <i>that</i> to be a
fault, which was evidently his misfortune.</p>
<p>Boundless was the mirth of Twm and Moses, as in their season
of rest they agitated the question as to what report they were to
make in the morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said the
waggish Jew-boy &ldquo;that we let the pig out, and say that he
escaped into the yard, and bit a goose, (which we can kill and
eat;) that the goose got mad and bit the wheel-barrow; that the
wheel-barrow dashed itself frantically against the dung-cart; and
that both together they rolled and rattled all night about the
yard, like the capering of ten thousand devils.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm
over-ruled this wild suggestion, and gave a report more consonant
with probabilities that the animal was more mad than ever, and
that he feared his malady would infect the stable, so as to make
it unsafe to put the horses there again till the walls were
white-washed and every part of it purified.</p>
<p>This was a grave and plausible position in which to place the
affair, and quite fell in with Morris&rsquo;s own way of
thinking; and at last he determined on having the maddened
monster, as he called him, killed and buried.&nbsp; This was at
last carried into effect by our young worthies, with the
assistance of Mike the mat-man, who inhabited a wretched hovel in
the neighbourhood, and maintained himself, a wife, and one child,
by making rush mats, and coarse willow baskets, which he hawked
over the country.&nbsp; Mike, of course, was let into the secret,
and in the night the worthy trio commenced their avocations of
body-snatchers.&nbsp; The much injured porker was disinterred,
and more honours were paid him after death, than had ever been
conferred <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>upon him in life.&nbsp; But this is the way with human
beings, sometimes, as well as with the denizens of the sty; and
if we choose to moralize, we have an excellent opportunity given
us&mdash;but we forbear.</p>
<p>Many and merry were the evenings spent over the remains of the
pork, by Twm and Moses, under the humble roof of Mike the mat-man
and his wife, who were equal partakers of the feast.&nbsp; These
promising youths, on pretending to retire to their nightly rest,
made a point of hastening to the place of goodly food and
pleasant smells, where they spent the greater part of the night,
and thus acquired their earliest taste for dissipation.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Moses</span> displays his
inventive power in catching mutton.&nbsp; The storm bursts, and
the tricks of Twm and Moses are discovered.&nbsp; Hukin Heer
informs, and receives his reward.&nbsp; The house is in an
uproar.</p>
<p>As the material of their feasting was waning, like a pleasant
moon that declines towards the latter quarter, Moses grew more
and more uneasy, as foul food or starvation was staring him in
the face, night and day.&nbsp; As he utterly failed to sleep, he
employed the silent hours of midnight to hatch a scheme for the
procurement of future provender.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twm,&rdquo; quoth
the young schemer one morning, &ldquo;you love mutton, and so do
I; and as you provided the pancakes and the pigs, as well as the
fish, (a quinsey fill the throats that swallowed them!) it is now
my turn to be founder of the feast.&nbsp; I will not only find
the feast, but I will manage matters so well, that Sheeny Greeg
herself shall cook it for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he related, as Morris had informed him, <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>how in former
years the sheep had repeatedly fallen headlong from the height of
Allty Craig, and been killed, and how since those times he had
made a thick hedge to keep them from the edge of the
precipice.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t be so particular
now,&rdquo; said Moses, &ldquo;for I mean to get up an accident
for one of the sheep.&nbsp; Then we may eat and be happy again;
we&rsquo;ll have a change this time.&nbsp; It was pork before,
and now we&rsquo;ll have mutton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Twm, &ldquo;only do it
all yourself, then we shall see what you can do without my
assistance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus challenged, Moses felt it as a
point of humour to proceed in the affair alone.</p>
<p>Explanatory of what follows, it is here necessary to quote the
observation of one of our best South Wales tourists, on the
subject of the Welsh hilly sheep.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was much
struck,&rdquo; says Malkin, &ldquo;with the difference between
the hilly sheep and those of the vale; the former are not only
smaller, but infinitely more elegant and picturesque in
figure.&nbsp; They seemed to have all their wits about them, so
that one would think the race had acquired its proverbial
character for silliness by feeding on rich and artificial
pastures, without having inherited it originally in the state of
nature.&nbsp; When we got into the lane, we met with a flock of
several hundred, which live among the rocks all the year round,
only coming down in shearing time.&nbsp; They had us in front,
and their shepherd and his dog in the rear.&nbsp; <i>The bounds
many of them made in avoiding us</i>, <i>were equally powerful
and lofty with those of wild goats</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even such was the woolly tribe, from which the insatiate Jew
was now preparing to select a victim.&nbsp; Ambitious of the sole
credit of the enterprise, he desired Twm to stay below and leave
him to follow his own plan.&nbsp; Scarcely thinking of the matter
in hand, Twm took his seat on a gate, opposite to the lofty cliff
of Allty Craig Llwyd, pondering in his mind about his distant
home, the loved scenes which he had left for these, and above
all, his mother, from <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>whom he had been so long
separated.&nbsp; Moses wound up the hill, and attained the top at
the back of the cliff.</p>
<p>With the assistance of the farm-dog he soon drove one of the
finest of the wethers into the angular nook formed by the hedge
of the adjoining wood, and that which screened from the edge of
the terrific cliff.&nbsp; The dog, being set on, barked and bit
incessantly, while Moses shouted and bellowed with waving arms,
till, worried by stupidity at last, the sheep bounded up, and
sprang far over the hedge, and downward in the yielding
air&mdash;ignorant of the yawning gulf behind the hedge, and the
snare laid for his life!&nbsp; Moses set up a triumphant yell
like that of a wild Indian, as he peered over the precipice and
saw the downward movements of the poor sheep.&nbsp; Startled with
the shout of Moses, at this moment Twm looked up, and saw the
animal describing a rainbow sweep, and turning over and over in
its descent through the air, and its ultimate fall into the
quarry beneath, where it dropped lifeless.</p>
<p>So little did our hero relish this cruel affair that he would
scarcely speak to Moses, when the latter expected high applause
for his handywork.&nbsp; But the Jew-boy, nothing daunted, ran to
the farmer, whom he found cobbling up an old plough in the yard,
to save expense of paying a wheelwright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&nbsp; Oh dear!&rdquo; whined Moses, with the
greatest appearance of heart-touched concern, &ldquo;a terrible
accident has happened&mdash;one of the sheep&mdash;the fattest
and finest of the whole flock&mdash;has just sprung over the
hedge above Allty Craig, and broke its beautiful
neck.&rdquo;&nbsp; Morris threw down the axe he was using, and
looked nearly as sorry, angry, and despondent as he felt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nothing but misfortunes!&rdquo; cried he at last,
&ldquo;nothing but misfortunes for me, wretched man that I
am!&rdquo; his thoughts dwelling at that moment on the fine pig
that he lately lost.&nbsp; &ldquo;First a fine pig, and now my
finest sheep.&nbsp; Verily, this must be the end of the world,
such judgments could not come without reason!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better cut his throat to save his
life,&rdquo; inquired Moses in the most compassionate and tender
tone that he could assume, forgetting the slight anomaly which
his suggestion presented; &ldquo;and then, sir, hadn&rsquo;t we
better skin him too?&rdquo; continued the young slip of
Judaism.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he isn&rsquo;t bled directly, and
nothing said about the accident, the women will vote him to be
buried in the same grave with the hog, considering his beautiful
mutton as no better than so much carrion.&nbsp; You know the
women are so shamefully dainty in such matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wily speech won the entire approbation of Morris Greeg,
and patting Moses&rsquo;s shoulder, he thanked Providence that he
had so faithful a servant; adding in the same breath, &ldquo;be
sure you don&rsquo;t cut the skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This gave Twm and Moses full employment for the rest of the
evening, while Morris entered the house, and delivered the
startling intelligence to his household that he had determined to
give them all a treat, and that for this purpose he had ordered
one of the finest sheep to be slaughtered, that they might have
fresh mutton.</p>
<p>It was just as the first dinner from this promised feast was
finished, on the day following, that Hukin Heer, that tall lanky
cottager, whose dog had been killed by Moses, under the
imputation of madness, called on Morris and Sheeny; and in a
self-sufficient mysterious manner, informed them that he had a
long story to tell them.&nbsp; As he cast a furious look at
Moses, that worthy felt an inward conviction that his long story
boded him no good; so taking up his hat in a hurried manner, he
prepared to depart.&nbsp; Hukin Heer, however, told Morris, that
as his tidings concerned the whole household, and that he was a
man who scorned to criminate any one behind his back, he
particularly wished that Moses and Twm should be present, to hear
all that he had to urge against them.&nbsp; Moses treated his
insinuations with a bold look of defiance as his insignificant
features could <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>possibly assume, yet trembling with dread that some
important discoveries to his disadvantage were to be made.</p>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s only amusement at that moment consisted in
watching the terrified expression upon the countenance of the
young Israelite, and in mentally commenting upon the probable
consequences of Heer&rsquo;s information.&nbsp; Now all the
family were seated round; Hukin occupying a chair that commanded
the passage, in case the culprits aimed to escape, and Sheeny
with her female brood, bursting with curiosity to hear what
diableries Hukin had to unfold.</p>
<p>It turned out that this unlucky cottager, on the destruction
of whose cur, by the relentless hand of Moses, fled in the utmost
alarm at the supposed damages done by him, according to the
insinuations of Twm, under the influence of canine madness.&nbsp;
This, Hukin knew to be a fabrication, and suspecting the rest to
be so, indulged in bitter feelings of resentment against the
insignificant Jew whelp, as he called him, who on false pretences
had destroyed his poor dog.&nbsp; Brooding over his wrongs, he at
times revenged himself, in the early dark winter evenings, by
tearing the hedges of Morris Greeg, by which amiable pastime he
repaired the deficiency of his own fuel, and gave endless labour
to those parish apprentices to repair them.</p>
<p>One eventful evening he caught up the clue which furnished him
with the means of revenge.&nbsp; He was returning home, after
despoiling the hedges, when he heard the sound of footsteps; at
once he concealed himself and his load of faggots, and like a
stealthy spy, awaited the results.&nbsp; While in this position,
by the imperfect light of a dull moon, he caught a full view of
Twm and Moses.&nbsp; Abandoning his load of wood, he dogged their
steps till they were housed in the hovel of Mike the
mat-man.&nbsp; He then saw the inmates enjoying the lingering
remains of the pig, gloating over it, and making sundry comments
which might, to say the least, be considered suspicious.&nbsp;
For <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>several nights Heer followed them, and saw the same
scene enacted; he had at last gathered a full and connected
narrative of the whole affair, and it was an intense satisfaction
to have these sweet means of revenge in his possession.</p>
<p>On the day previous to the present, in the full glow of
triumphant malice, he called on Mike, and informed him that his
midnight feastings were discovered.&nbsp; Poor Mike trembled with
apprehension of the evil consequences that might accrue to him;
and in the hope of propitiating the angry spirit of his
revengeful neighbour, confessed all he knew, which was
everything, about the matter.&nbsp; It seemed as if the spirit of
vengeance had yielded a favourable ear to Hukin&rsquo;s desires;
for on this same evening, as he lurked in the wood adjoining
Allty Craig, and only separated from it by the hedge, it was his
lot to witness the last enormity of Moses, in driving the sheep,
on which they had been feeding, over the dreadful precipice.</p>
<p>All these particulars, with the exception of his own part in
despoiling the hedges, he narrated before the present assembled
party, with the most enlarged minuteness, while the different
members of the family were agitated with various feelings as they
listened to his exaggerated account of the affair.</p>
<p>Vain would be the attempt to seek words that could do adequate
justice in describing the effects of this discovery on the
countenance of the economic Morris, and that amiable provider of
short commons, his wife.&nbsp; If one groaned forth her
unutterable grief, the other ground his teeth; and in the
vehemence of his wrath could not help thinking that the penal
statutes required amendment&mdash;that it was an infamous
interference on the part of the law to call the sacrifice of a
parish apprentice or two, in the way of just resentment, by the
hideous name of murder; while to his thinking, it was much less
criminal than clandestinely killing a pig or a sheep, that would
fetch so much more money.&nbsp; Almost delirious with his
troubles, he paced the house to and fro, at the frantic rate of
five miles to the hour, <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>muttering to himself a complete
summary of the evils that had befallen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pig not mad&mdash;tickled by the sand in his
ear&mdash;all eaten by the boys and the mat-man&mdash;curse their
stomachs!&mdash;sheep driven over the precipice&mdash;worth ten
shillings&mdash;Oh!&mdash;villainy unheard of&mdash;the world was
innocent till now&mdash;all former villainy child&rsquo;s play to
this&mdash;the latter day is coming fast&mdash;signs like these
are not given for nothing!&nbsp; The prophets have
said&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of all the fine lard, you
cut-throat villains?&rdquo; whined Sheeny, in the most touching
accents, thinking of the <i>tesian vroy</i>, or short cake, that
was lost to her forever; while the younger lasses looked
bewildered at the prophetic passage alluded, and wondering where
it was to be found.&nbsp; As nobody answered her interesting
inquiry, Sheeny continued to bite her nails and drum the
devil&rsquo;s tattoo with the heel of the wooden shoe; while
Hukin Heer grinned like a demon at the mischief which he had
made.</p>
<p>Both Morris and Sheeny were at length roused from their stupor
by the inquiry of Hukin,&mdash;&ldquo;Well, what be you going to
do with them?&nbsp; I have a couple of hairy halters in my
pockets here, that I brought for the purpose; we had better tie
their hands behind them, and send them at once in a cart to jail,
where they will be hanged, drawn, and quarted, as a warning to
all rogues who take away the lives of innocent
dogs,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and pigs!&rdquo; roared Griffith;
&ldquo;and sheep!&rdquo; shrieked Sheeny, as a climax to the
whole.</p>
<p>Twm and Moses were on the alert, and in less time than it
takes us to narrate the fact, Moses threw a three-legged stool at
the informer, and that with such force that it fractured the
elbow-bone of his right arm.&nbsp; In an instant Hukin recovered
himself, and was about to rush on the young Jew.&nbsp; But Twm
Shon Catty was ready, his &ldquo;soul was in arms and eager for
the fray.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Hukin advanced, Twm launched a heavy
oaken stool at his head, which laid his lank carcass on the
floor, bathed in blood.&nbsp; The scene was almost taking a
tragic turn when Sheeny changed its spirit by attacking <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Moses with a
birch broom, while one of the younger was pricking him in the
breech with a toasting-fork, till he blared like a beaten
calf.&nbsp; In the confusion of the fray, Shaan attacked her
father with a dirty flummery ladle, that whitened and disfigured
his black beard and whiskers, as if a barber had commenced his
operations, while the good man stood open-mouthed marvelling
whether these were not additional signs of approaching doom.</p>
<p>Aware that these ladle-bastings were intended for himself, Twm
caught Shaan behind, and holding her elbows fast to her sides,
gave her a twist round, and inflicting a tremendous kiss on her
fat blubbery lips; then pouting with passion, he loosened his
hold, and springing over the prostrate carcass of Hukin Heer,
retreated through the doorway in good order.&nbsp; Moses
followed, but with considerable confusion; dodging his head, and
rubbing his seat of honour in his retreat, as the visions of
birch-brooms and toasting-forks haunted him long after he was far
beyond their reach, whilst seating himself was made a painful
operation, and he mentally thought he had undergone the same
punishment as he had seen somewhere in an old print, where his
satanic majesty was impaling an old witch in that portion of her
body, <i>for the convenience of which</i>, <i>chairs were
originally invented</i>.</p>
<h2><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">The</span> flight of the
Israelite and Mike.&nbsp; Mirth changed to grief.&nbsp; Killing
by kindness, and saving by neglect.&nbsp; A bright vision, and a
supernatural se&aacute;nce.&nbsp; The end of the miserly
household.</p>
<p>On Twm&rsquo;s rushing out of the house, he sought his bed in
the hay-loft, and laying himself down, laughed incessantly, at
the thought of the scene just passed; at the same time wondering
what had become of his luckless fellow in mischief, whom he
momentarily expected to follow him.&nbsp; Moses, however, was so
confused by his head-drubbings from the broom of Sheeny, and
tail-piercing from the fork of little Gwenny, that failing to see
Twm in his retreat, he ran straight forward, without knowing
whither.&nbsp; But the very legs of Moses without the guidance of
his head, seemed to have a predilection for the favourite road
which led to the house of feasting; as in this instance they bore
him without pause, till housed in the hovel of Mike, the
mat-man.</p>
<p>Poor Mike, he found busied in packing up, and loading his pony
with a cargo of mats, and preparing for immediate departure,
fearing that day-light would send somebody to take cognizance of
the share which he had taken in devouring Morris Greeg&rsquo;s
swine-flesh.&nbsp; Moses related all that had passed, and
entreated that he might become his companion in his present
excursion; assuring him that he had as sweet a voice for crying
mats as he could meet with in a month&rsquo;s march.</p>
<p>Mike assented, and told him to fortify his stomach with what
his hut afforded, against the dangers of the midnight air, a hint
which was seldom thrown away upon him.&nbsp; The good-natured
wife of the mat-man earnestly requested her husband to divide the
head of the pig (the only part left!) between himself and
Moses.&nbsp; That youth seconded the motion; observing <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>it was
dangerous to leave any portion of it behind, as, though dead, it
might tell tales, and be claimed by some of the Greeg family;
feelingly remarking, &ldquo;if you have any more pork, rather
than you should get into a scrape, I&rsquo;ll risk it, and take
it all myself.&mdash;I am not so selfish as to begrudge to carry
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mike winked at his wife, intimating that he <i>knew</i> his
customer.&nbsp; Next morning our hero called at the
mat-man&rsquo;s house, with the laudable desire of putting him on
his guard, intending to communicate the adventures and
disclosures of the preceding day.&nbsp; But he was doomed to
disappointment.&nbsp; Mike had &ldquo;cleared out&rdquo; three
hours before, escorted by the Israelite, whilst the wife had been
left behind to &ldquo;take care of the things,&rdquo; and to be
the link that should join them to more auspicious times.&nbsp;
This breach of good-fellowship on the part of Moses, in leaving
him so abruptly, piqued and fretted him not a little.&nbsp; With
a commendable spirit that disdained to act the paltry part of a
run-away, he entered the house of Morris Greeg at the usual
breakfast hour, and took his meal in silence.&nbsp; Sheeny kept
her bed this morning, overcome by the tumults of the preceding
evening, and Shaan officiated in her place.</p>
<p>The absence of Moses was very slightly commented upon, both
father and daughter declaring it would have been well for them if
he had taken himself off much sooner; yet, under all this feigned
indifference, it was very perceivable to Twm that his loss was
much felt by them.&nbsp; Under a couple of old sacks on the
settle by the fire lay the damaged body of Hukin Heer, where he
had been groaning all night.&nbsp; Without the slightest
reference to the past, Twm was told that his first job that
morning would be to take Hukin home in a dung-cart, charging him
to put plenty of clean straw under him, so that he might ride in
style and comfort.</p>
<p>Thus Twm had to perform an office for an enemy, who the day
before volunteered to do the same for him,&mdash;under different
circumstances, that he was to <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>be pinioned like a felon, bound hand
and foot, and escorted to the county jail, a reversion of the
scene which Twm liked rather than otherwise.&nbsp; It reminded
him of the gallows which the scriptural Jew had made for some one
else, but eventually took his position there himself.</p>
<p>On Twm&rsquo;s return, after depositing Hukin with his wife,
whose inquiries he cut short, by urging his haste, he was
surprised to find that although it was the dinner hour, no food
was prepared, nor was any one member of the family to be seen or
heard.&nbsp; This unusual stillness he considered as strangely
contrasting with the bustle and agitation of the previous day,
nor could he in any way account for it.&nbsp; At length the deep
silence was feebly broken by some voices upstairs, in the
softened tones of pitying condolement, succeeded by the heavy
sobbing of a female, amidst the earnest and agonized prayer of a
gruff broken voice, which he at once knew to be that of
Morris.</p>
<p>At length he recognized the well-known voice of Sheeny, amidst
the loud wailing of her daughters, passionately exclaiming,
&ldquo;It is&mdash;O God, it is&mdash;that murderous disorder,
the white-plague pest!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the expressive name
by which that awful visitor since known by the name of small-pox,
was announced to be in the house.&nbsp; An indescribable vague
feeling of terror thrilled through his whole frame, as the
dreadful fact became known to him.&nbsp; As in those days
scarcely any one knew how to treat this remorseless enemy of the
race of man, its very existence in the neighbourhood was deemed a
certain messenger of doom, and even in those rare cases where the
life of the infected was spared, the envious demon stamped
fearful foulness on the face of beauty, and hideously scarified
the smoothest cheek, so that the parent knew not the features of
his child.</p>
<p>The first hasty thought that crossed our hero&rsquo;s mind,
was to fly, and escape while yet clear of the contagion; but in
an instant his nobler though mistaken feelings abjured the
thought, bad as they had <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>been to him, of deserting this
afflicted family in the dark day of their heavy visitation.&nbsp;
However, his presence was no more noticed than his absence would
have been.&nbsp; Day after day, things remained in a similar
state; at length the lower part of the house was absolutely
deserted, or inhabited by him alone.&nbsp; Even the fire was
extinguished, and the house might have been uninhabited for
anything to be seen to the contrary.&nbsp; There were no sounds,
except the occasional groans of Morris, and the cries of the
frightened females.&nbsp; The family assembled together upstairs,
almost courting infection by their presence, and Twm was
therefore left to provide for his own wants.</p>
<p>Rarely could he meet with any one to enquire, as his feelings
prompted, who were the sufferers, and how they fared.&nbsp; The
third day since the commencement of the sickness, as he sat
lonely and languidly, from the disordered state of his stomach,
unable to partake of the dry food before him, a shriek of women
announced some fatality to have taken place.&nbsp; Morris came
down, with streaming eyes and agitated face, and for the first
time in his life grasping his hand in friendly wise, emphatically
proved how suffering had subdued his selfishness, and humanized
his hard heart.&nbsp; At length, with broken voice, he said,
&ldquo;She is gone&mdash;my youngest girl is gone,&mdash;and I
fear my little Gwen will follow soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even while commiserating with Morris, Twm complained of a
head-ache, and a loathing sickness, with a feverish burning of
the whole frame, that was overwhelming him.&nbsp; Morris
immediately saw that he was infected, and told him to go and lie
down; informing his family of the feeling evinced by him for
their suffering, and that he was decidedly in the disorder.&nbsp;
Then taking his staff he hurried to the different cottages that
were thinly scattered among the lonely mountain cwms or dingles,
with the hope that either kindness or considerations of interest
would induce an elderly female or two to engage with him as
nurses, to watch and attend the sick.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>Accordingly, two that had gone through the ordeal of
the <i>frech wen</i>, or the white pest, as the small-pox was
called, accompanied him home.&nbsp; They commenced their office
by making a regular, roasting fire, and feasting themselves in
the best manner the house afforded, attending to number one
first, as it behoved all nurses to do, their patients for the
time being of course quite a secondary consideration.&nbsp;
Feasting to inaugurate their arrival, they averred was an ancient
custom, and must be adhered to.&nbsp; He knew not whether it was
an ancient one; but that it is a <i>convenient</i> one, none
could deny.&nbsp; Twm soon found himself at the height of the
malady.&nbsp; Well for him was it, that the fever and other
accompaniments of this fearful disorder removed from him all
desire for food&mdash;for none was brought to him; none called to
offer their kindly offices, nor to inquire how he fared; and he
had to feel in the acutest degree the abandoned lot of that
&ldquo;no man&rsquo;s child,&rdquo; the sick and suffering parish
apprentice.&nbsp; His bed in the hay-loft was an old hop-sack,
half filled with the chaff of oats; and his covering an old
tattered blanket, and a musty rug that had served several offices
for horses.</p>
<p>Thus, with the whistling of the wind through the numerous
crevices of the crazy walls, and the rain dripping on him at
times, through the imperfect rotten thatch, he remained hours,
days, and dreary nights, groaning away his time, impatiently
longing for death, or speedy recovery.&nbsp; When daylight
dawned, his mind wearied by aches and pains of the body, and by a
complete absence of the power of thought, would seek some
occupation and amusement in speculation on the formation of the
dark heavy folds of the numerous cob-webs that waved to and fro
over his head, from the mouldy beams and rafters, like the
triumphant flags of squalid penury; while the squeaking of mice,
that ran in troops about him, became the miserable music that
served to vary the monotony of his heavy hours.</p>
<p>One night, while doubly darkened, both by the deep <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>shades of
midnight, and his eyes scaled by the glutinous adhesion of the
putrid &ldquo;pest,&rdquo; lonely and uncared for, he was cheered
and comforted in a manner as mysterious as it was
delightful.&nbsp; In after years, when referring to the
circumstances about to be detailed, marvellous and incredible as
it may appear, he always protested with a solemnity that he
deemed the subject called for, that he was neither absorbed in
slumber at its occurrence, nor under the influence of the
slightest delirium, but wakeful and sensible as ever he was
during his healthful mid-day avocations.</p>
<p>Turning upon his humble bed, wearied by the long and continued
gloom, weakened by continual aches and pains, a chorus of sweet
voices broke upon his ear, ravishing from the beauty of its
strains.&nbsp; In an instant afterwards, the wretched gloom was
dispersed by a brilliant light which burst into the loft, and
made all the old familiar objects radiant with a most unearthly
brilliance.&nbsp; Simultaneously with the sight and sound,
pleasant sensations sprang within his breast, and every pain had
vanished.&nbsp; While striving with the efforts of reason to
account for what he had felt and mentally beheld, to his
unutterable wonder, a tall female form appeared beside his lowly
bed, in full glow of youth and beauty, arrayed in costly
attire.</p>
<p>She had nothing about her allied to what he called the
supernatural&mdash;all seemed perfect reality&mdash;and although
exceedingly lovely, and benevolent in aspect, she was nothing
more nor less than a living &ldquo;lady of the land,&rdquo; in
widow&rsquo;s weeds of the costly habiliments of the present
time.&nbsp; As he sank abashed from her fixed and smiling gaze,
she extended one of the finest hands he had ever beheld, and
pointed to two marriage rings, one above the other, on the third
finger of the left hand.&nbsp; He gazed steadfastly on the rings,
and, as he thought, he saw a third one above the others, of a
much paler hue; but on viewing it closer, it appeared simply a
white narrow silken ribbon, tied in that peculiar fashion, called
a true-lover&rsquo;s knot.&nbsp; Twice <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>he looked
from the finger to the face, struggling to give utterance to the
question that was trembling on his lips, as to the meaning
indicated, when a shriek from the house thrilled through his
heart; the glorious vision with the heavenly accompaniments of
light and music, were in an instant gone.</p>
<p>The lovely picture vanished, leaving poor Twm more chagrined
than ever was Tantalus.&nbsp; Like the mirage, it vanished and
faded away, leaving the weary gazer disappointed and
dispirited.&nbsp; But still the heart of Twm was comforted with
high, though baseless hopes, that fortune had some precious gift
in store for him, which time would yet bring forth.</p>
<p>The pleasurable sensations excited in the breast of our
worthy, by what he ever after called his &ldquo;glorious
vision,&rdquo; in healing the mind, had the auspicious effect in
cicatrizing his body.&nbsp; But as he recovered his sight, and
found the fever abandoning him, his appetite increased, and he
became at length tremendously hungry, with apparently nothing
within his reach to appease his inward cravings; and he was yet
too weak to quit his loft in search of any food.</p>
<p>At times, indeed, somewhat nerved, or rather maddened by his
rage for food, his weak hands would rustle in the pea-straw that
was heaped between his bed and the wall; and occasionally, after
a long search, to his great joy, he would discover an unbroken
pea-shell that had escaped the searching of the flail, while in
the act of thrashing in the barn.&nbsp; He had heard tales of
shipwreck and disaster, when lots had been cast between the
mariners as to which should be killed to furnish food for the
rest.&nbsp; He could believe them all now, whatever doubt he
might have had before.&nbsp; If he could now discover a neglected
pea-shell, in spite of the soreness of his hands and mouth, he
would open it and devour it with the utmost avidity.&nbsp; Just
as this wretched resource was failing him, one day, after a vain
and heart-aching search for another pea-pod, a sudden rustle in
the straw startled him, and <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>in great alarm he drew back his
hand, in the dread of coming in contact with a rat.</p>
<p>From this feeling he was agreeably relieved by the clucking of
a hen, that in the same moment descended through a hole in the
floor of the loft into the stable below.&nbsp; This homely
&ldquo;household fowl&rdquo; now became his &ldquo;bird of good
omen,&rdquo; which in after years he adopted as his crest; for
after a short search he discovered no less than three of her
eggs.&nbsp; This was indeed &ldquo;manna in the wilderness&rdquo;
to his declining hopes.&nbsp; A spring in the desert to the
parched pilgrim; a port and safety to the shipwrecked mariner;
wealth unexpected to the victim of poverty.&nbsp; Not one of
those electrifying &ldquo;God-sends&rdquo; was ever welcome with
greater heartfelt thankfulness, than the humble prize presented
to our hero.&nbsp; But this assistance, however welcome at the
time,&mdash;and wildly welcome it most truly was,&mdash;proved
after all but temporary.</p>
<p>Thus, although recovering fast from the horrors of the
small-pox, he was in the perilous jeopardy of becoming a victim
to starvation.&nbsp; Yet hope was strong within him, and wild,
young, and thoughtless as he was, he was no stranger to the
comfort to be derived from a dependence on Providence.</p>
<p>While the cravings of hunger assailed the poor parish
apprentice with unrelenting wolfishness, very different was the
treatment of the suffering children of the house.&nbsp; The
neglect visited upon the poor parish apprentice, was avenged by
the attention paid to the children of Morris.&nbsp; Twm&rsquo;s
neglect proved his salvation, while the unremitting kindness
(mistaken though it was), shown to the farmer&rsquo;s offspring,
proved their destruction, for Morris literally <i>killed them
with kindness</i>.&nbsp; Without judgment, or advice, except from
those self-interested conceited nurses, who were more ignorant
than herself; Sheeny Greeg sought every delicacy to coax the
waned and pampered appetites of her afflicted ones.</p>
<p>Every breath of pure air studiously excluded from <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>their room,
they were almost suffocated by the quantity of clothes in which
they were wrapped.&nbsp; She gave them the most delicate cakes
that the homely hands of her assistants could contrive, with
spiced and sugared ale, and even wine; so thoroughly was the
accumulating spirit of avarice swallowed up by the nobler and
more powerful passion of affection for their perishing young
ones; a feeling after all, more eulogized than it really merits,
as it is but another mortification of human selfishness.</p>
<p>Three victims had already succumbed to the ravages of the
disease, and their fourth child now lay at the door of
death.&nbsp; Lamentations and groans were continual, but no
proper means for the recovery of the patients were adopted.&nbsp;
A poor hedge carpenter came from the distant village of Mawn Dee,
and brought with him the last covering of the victims of disease,
placing them, with assistance, in the slight alder coffins; the
parents took their heart-rent final look, and sank insensible
with excessive grief;&mdash;and yet the nurses feasted.&nbsp;
They continued to roast and boil, piously hoping their valuable
services would be long wanted; and although none of the family
could partake of their cookery, yet, the nurses feasted!&nbsp;
These good ladies, however, were rather disturbed at this time in
their comfortable doings, as some of the Mawn Dee women, like the
vulture which smells the warfield and the human gore afar off,
followed in the wake of the carpenter, hoping by a little canting
condolement with the family, to be engaged; but finding the field
occupied, they were guilty, as their opponents said, of the
heinous offence of offering their services gratis, to sit up in
their turn and watch the sick.</p>
<p>This, it must be said, was ever a welcome office to persons of
this description, especially at a substantial house; as on such
occasions as watching the sick, and laying out the dead, feasting
is as prevalent as at weddings.&nbsp; As the paid nurses who
assumed the consequence of regulars, failed to eject the
volunteers, who were more numerous, they revenged themselves by
<a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>giving
them all the work to do except what appertained to swilling and
mastication; their own veteran talents bearing the full brunt of
that important piece of service, which was not to be trusted to
mere mercenary recruits.</p>
<p>Superstition was rampant amongst these old hen-wives.&nbsp;
All sorts of intimations concerning future events were made out
of very simple occurrences.&nbsp; No one must go under a ladder,
if they would enter the matrimonial noose.&nbsp; Salt was a very
unfortunate article of diet, whilst candlewicks were made a
medium for the discovery of a coming death.&nbsp; Some of these
old grannies dilated upon corpse candles seen by them previous to
the deaths of the young women of the house; others dilated on the
awfulness of a spectral burial, where shadows of the living
supported the bier of the departed towards the church-yard.</p>
<p>One night, between twelve and one, while the three coffins and
their contents presented a woeful sight, lying side by side on
the oak table, Morris, afflicted as he was, assisted his wife in
supporting by the fireside his fourth daughter, whose death they
also deeply dreaded, as an old cottage woman, while she basted a
loin of mutton roasting before the fire, dwelt much on the
certainty of supernatural appearances, illustrating her
convictions by instances of her own experience.&nbsp; All at
once, the current of her discourse was arrested by a shudder that
overcame and struck her dumb, on hearing a rumbling and irregular
noise, as of falling furniture, which also terrified the group
about the fire.&nbsp; The noise increased, and at last seemed as
if somebody was stumbling in his way in the dark.</p>
<p>Some shrieked, some rose and ran to remote corners, covering
their head with their aprons, while others sat breathless, as if
nailed to the bench, and dissolved in streams of perspiration,
their eyes starting from their sockets&mdash;when a figure with
the air and rush of a maniac darted in, tore the roasting meat
from the string, and disappeared with it, uttering in a dismal
hollow tone,</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;O God, I am famished by these
wretches!&rdquo;&nbsp; The consciences of the farmer and his wife
were dreadfully wrung, as they recollected the poor apprentice
Twm, whom they had left in the depth of the malady which had
deprived them of three of their children, to live or to die, as
he might; nor would Morris allow anybody to rescue the meat, but
snatching a loaf from the shelf, he entreated Twm to come in and
eat his fill at the fire.&nbsp; But the youngster having secured
the bread, re-entered his hay-loft, and with the ravenousness of
a starved hound devoured his precious prey in darkness.&nbsp;
That was the sweetest meal ever eaten by our hero.</p>
<p>In narrating this event in after life, he used to say that the
theft of this joint saved his life.&nbsp; He was then as ravenous
as a wolf, and was only endowed with supernatural strength for
the moment, to effect his purpose.&nbsp; While yet the farmer,
with tears of real penitence, was calling out to him, a loud
scream from his wife convinced him that his fourth child was also
dead.</p>
<p>With wild and insupportable agony, Morris fell upon his knees,
and with interrupting sobs exclaimed, &ldquo;I see the hand of
Heaven in this, and a heavy judgment has befallen us for our
cruelty to the poor boy; but he will live! he! the lad whom we
treated fouler than the beast! he will outlive this pest, while I
and mine perish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suffering of the unhappy man was pitiable and
heart-rending to witness; and on the very day of his
children&rsquo;s burial, with loud cries of remorse and sorrow,
he expired.</p>
<p>Twm recovered, according to the farmer&rsquo;s prediction,
which was further verified, inasmuch as the remainder of his
children did not live to see the end of the year; and his wife,
losing her senses, was ever after a wretched moping idiot.</p>

109</span>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">The</span> return of our
hero to Tregaron.&nbsp; His welcome from old friends, cronies,
and acquaintances.&nbsp; Is engaged by Squire Graspacre, and is
elevated socially and physically.</p>
<p>After setting out early in the morning, and walking all day
over the rugged mountain road, the heart of Twm Short Catty
thrilled with delight, and the tears filled in his eyes, when,
late in the evening, his own native place, the humble town of
Tregaron appeared before him.&nbsp; Each object that met his
eager gaze was familiar; not a shrub but Twm knew it, not a spot
but was remembered in Twm&rsquo;s mind by some vagary or other
practised either by himself or the renowned Watt; and although
his feet were so blistered that he could scarcely move, he
attempted to make his limbs partake of the new vigour which
sprung up in his heart, and essayed to run, but failing in his
aim, fell down completely mastered by exhaustion and
fatigue.&nbsp; Whether, like Brutus, he was re-nerved by
breathing awhile on the bosom of his mother earth, or that the
thoughts within, of home and its association, gave him strength,
he rose much refreshed, but with considerable pain continued the
short untraced portion of his journey.</p>
<p>Entering the town, at length, just as the darkness began to
veil every object, he came to his mother&rsquo;s door, which was
open, and cast an inquiring look before he entered.&nbsp; Catty
had long dismissed her scholars, and sat in the chimney corner
with her back towards the door; whilst Carmarthen Jack was busily
engaged upon an artistic combination upon the handle of a
ladle.&nbsp; He was a thoroughly business man, as far as spoons
and ladles were concerned, and on this occasion he sat sullenly
busy in scooping out the bowl of a new ladle.</p>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s merry trick-loving soul is not to be subdued by
his troubles; having drawn his flat-rimmed old hat over his eyes,
he leaned over his mother&rsquo;s hatch, and in <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>a feigned
voice, begged for a piece of bread and cheese, saying that he was
a poor boy, very hungry and tired, who was making his way home to
Lampeter.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are poor folk ourselves, and have
nothing to give,&rdquo; said Carmarthen jack, rather
gruffly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Catty, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
a poor child, Jack, a bit of bread and cheese is not much, and
somebody might take pity on my poor Twm, and give him as much, if
he should need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The affectionate heart of Twm could no longer contain itself,
but opening the latch, he burst forward, dashing his hat on the
ground, and falling on her neck, giving the most ardent utterance
to the word &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; and after the tender pause of
nature&rsquo;s own embrace, he cried with streaming eyes,
&ldquo;My good, kind, charitable mother! you shall never want
bread and cheese while your poor Twm has health and strength to
earn it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Warmly returning his embrace and kisses,
Catty long clasped her boy, and was quite terrified to see his
pale lean cheek, and altered looks.&nbsp; Ashamed of the exposure
of his pitiless nature, Jack now came up, shook hands and
condoled with him, but Twm <i>had seen the man</i>, <i>and loved
him not</i>.</p>
<p>Twm was an excellent judge of human nature, and he knew well
the duplicity and cunning of his father-in-law, and shunned him
accordingly.&nbsp; Twm would never fraternize harmoniously with
those he did not like.&nbsp; In this, he was invariably
honest.</p>
<p>After being refreshed, Catty eagerly enquired of all that had
happened to him since he left home, and wept much as he detailed
his narrow escape from starvation and the small-pox.&nbsp; By
twelve o&rsquo;clock next day, his tale was known to everybody at
Tregaron.</p>
<p>The catastrophe at Morris Greeg&rsquo;s, of course, was
considered a judgment from heaven for his miserly propensities;
and Ianto Gwyn again set his poetical muse at work, and after a
slight effort wrote a pathetic ballad, to the great edification
of old women and tender-hearted damsels, giving a <i>true and
particular</i> account of the whole affair; to which was attached
a moral on the <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>cruelty of mal-treating parish apprentices, and
stuffing them with mouldy bread and sour flummery.&nbsp; This
interesting ballad was daily sung by Watt, the mole-catcher, to
the English tune of Chevy Chase, which gained the good-will of
all those old cronies who had taken deep offence at his numerous
tricks.</p>
<p>Carmarthen Jack, although so careful of his bread and cheese,
was determined not to be outdone on this occasion, but brought
the graphic art to perpetuate his stepson&rsquo;s tale; that is
to say, he carved on a wooden bowl the figures of four beings,
well-attended, in bed, with the scythe of death across their
throats, while in the distance a meagre boy was snatching a joint
of meat from the fire.&nbsp; The effort, artistically regarded,
was not calculated to carry away the Royal Academy&rsquo;s prize;
the idea perhaps was better than the execution; but altogether it
gained Jack very great applause.</p>
<p>Right glad were all Twm&rsquo;s cronies to see him again at
Tregaron; but dearer than all to him was the welcome of the
curate Rhys, with whose books he was again permitted to make
free, while he profited by his instructions and
conversation.&nbsp; He had now been at home about three months,
and recovered his health, strength and spirits to perfection;
when his mother fancied he had become an eye-sore to her husband,
who she thought looked at him with the scowling brow of a
step-father, which Twm&rsquo;s conduct, she might imagine,
justified, as his behaviour towards Jack had been very
unconciliating, ever since the bread and cheese adventure.</p>
<p>With this impression, Catty once more waited on Squire
Graspacre, to solicit that some employment should be found for
her boy, as she could not afford to keep him in idleness.&nbsp;
The tale of his sufferings at <i>Gwern Ddu</i>, interested the
squire in his favour; and he felt some reluctance to send him
again as a parish apprentice.&nbsp; The worthy curate, Rhys, had
also spoken a kind word in his late pupil&rsquo;s favour; and
Carmarthen Jack, gaping, hat in hand, looked as if he would say
much to get rid of his step-son, could he hit on <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>words to
his purpose.&nbsp; Amused by his simplicity and awkward gestures
the squire asked him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jack, what would you advise me to do with
Catty&rsquo;s boy?&rdquo;&nbsp; This plain question met with as
blunt an answer, &ldquo;Make him your servant boy, sir, if you
please.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And so I will, old hedgehog!&rdquo;
cried the squire, slapping him on the shoulder, &ldquo;Your
oratory has settled the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, our hero next appears as the squire&rsquo;s man
at Graspacre-Hall.&nbsp; This was an agreeable change in life to
him, where he lived, as they say in clover; and by his good
temper and turn for mirth, gained the good-will and admiration of
his fellow-servants, particularly the girls, with whom he became
an especial favourite.&nbsp; Behold him now in the seventeenth
year of his age, with his looks and habits of twenty, gay, happy,
and as mischievous as an ape; kissing and romping with the girls,
caring for none of them, but showing attentions to all, while he
jeered and mocked the cross-grained and disagreeable, and
whenever he could, raised a laugh at their peculiarities.&nbsp;
His employments at the squire&rsquo;s were various, among which,
waiting at table every day, neatly dressed, and carrying his
master&rsquo;s gun, and attending him during his shooting
excursions, formed the principal.</p>
<p>To these, Squire Graspacre, who since the death of his wife
was ever wench-hunting, aimed to add the noble office of pimp,
which Anglicized, means, the honourable office of wench-procurer,
to satisfy the lustful appetite of the squire.&nbsp; Twm,
however, had been swayed too long by the counsels of Rhys the
curate, to lend himself to any such service; and having by his
conversations with him, and by the tenor of his readings, imbibed
a taste for romantic honour, he was not without a secret hope
that his great father might some day own him, and destine him to
a very different sphere in life.&nbsp; With the growth of these
notions, rose in his mind a distaste for servitude, and an ardent
longing to shine in a sphere allied to literature and
respectability.</p>
<h2><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> goes the way of
all flesh, and &ldquo;falls in love.&rdquo;&nbsp; So does the
Squire, with Twm&rsquo;s maiden.&nbsp; Twm defeats his
master&rsquo;s scheme.&nbsp; The adventures of farmer
Cadwgan&rsquo;s ass.&nbsp; Twm makes his exit from Squire
Graspacre&rsquo;s &ldquo;local habitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squire and his man Twm returning one evening from grousing
on the hills, in their descent towards the valleys had to pass by
a small farm-house, inhabited by a tenant of the squire&rsquo;s,
who whispered Twm, &ldquo;This is the keep, the close, that
contains better game, and can afford livelier sport than any I
have had to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm by his silence testified his
ignorance of his drift; but he resumed, &ldquo;What! you
don&rsquo;t understand me? haven&rsquo;t you seen this
farmer&rsquo;s plump partridge of a daughter, the pretty Gwenny
Cadwgan, you young dog!&nbsp; I am determined to have that bird
down, some way or other, and you must help me.&nbsp; She is fine
game, and well worth bringing down.&nbsp; She will take time, I
know, but if she should be shy why then</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll weedle, coax, and try my
arts,<br />
For I can play a thousand parts;<br />
When she shall weep, I&rsquo;ll laugh and sing:<br />
The devil to my aid I&rsquo;ll bring.<br />
She&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er resist me long, I ween,<br />
For many a victory I have seen;<br />
The wench will kick, but what of that?<br />
I&rsquo;ll bear the brunt: she&rsquo;s plump and fat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before Twm could reply, the squire alighted and entered the
cottage, at the door of which the farmer and Gwenny Cadwgan, now
grown a fine and blooming young woman, met and welcomed their
landlord.&nbsp; Some oaten bread, butter, and cheese, and a cup
of homely-brewed ale were put before him; and while he ate, the
pretty Gwenny carried a portion to Twm, as he held the horses in
the yard.&nbsp; While he received the welcome food from the hand
of the happy smiling <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>girl, he perceived the blush with
which she gave it, and felt in his breast certain sensations no
less new than agreeable.</p>
<p>Thus, while each other made brief allusions to their days of
childhood, a tear started in the eyes of Twm, on seeing which the
bright eyes of Gwenny were also suffused, till the pearly drops
over-ran her fresh ruddy cheeks.&nbsp; Her father then calling
her in, she suddenly shook hands with, and left our hero, who in
that hour became a captive to her charms, while the innocent girl
herself then felt the first shooting of a passion that daily
grew, in sympathy with his own.</p>
<p>The squire having finished his hasty lunch, he remarked to his
tenant Cadwgan in a hurried manner, that he should have company
the next day to entertain at his house, and would thank him to
let his lass come to the hall to assist in attending on
them.&nbsp; The farmer of course, assented in words, for what
small farmer would dare to deny his landlord such a favour,
though his heart might tremble with apprehensions?</p>
<p>After the squire&rsquo;s departure, Cadwgan became deeply
distressed at the predicament in which he found himself; to deny
his landlord, was probably to lose his farm; and to assent to his
specious proposal, was to endanger, if not utterly ruin the
innocence of his darling daughter; as since the death of Mistress
Graspacre, more than one of the neighbouring damsels had to rue
their intimacy with the squire, who inveighled them to the hall
with all sorts of arts, pretences, and excuses, and then
contriving that he should be alone with the object of his lust,
had paid them a little of that &ldquo;delicate attention&rdquo;
which he had previously recommended to the father of Twm.&nbsp;
The poor farmer passed a restless night of bitter reflection, and
saw daylight with an agonized spirit; but the active mind imbued
with honourable ideas, never fails in due season to work its own
relief.</p>
<p>When Twm appeared next morning on horse-back before his door,
with a pillion behind, Cadwgan&rsquo;s terrors <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>had
vanished, his indignation at the premeditated injuries intended
him, was roused, and with braced nerves, and a firm heart, he
determined to deny the squire, and abide the consequences, be
what they might.&nbsp; But honest nature was elsewhere at work in
Cadwgan&rsquo;s favour, and unknown to him, had raised a friend
to save him from the impending perils, to the preservation of
both his farm and his more precious daughter, in the person of
young Twm Shon Catty.</p>
<p>On his journey home the last evening, while listening to his
master&rsquo;s commands, and hearing his plan to inveigle the
innocent Gwenny, Twm was mentally engaged in studying some mode
to preserve her from his clutches; and at length heroically
determined to save the object of his admiration, even at the risk
of losing his place, and being cast again on the wide
world.&nbsp; He fed his fancy all night in dwelling on her
beauty, and the merit of preserving her, while he ardently
enjoyed in anticipation the sacrifice he was about to make for
her sake.</p>
<p>The morning came, and the squire gave the dreaded order,
&ldquo;Take the horse Dragon, put a saddle and pillion on him,
and bring the farmer&rsquo;s lass behind you here; tell Cadwgan
not to expect her back to-night, but she shall be brought
to-morrow, and by that time, Twm, we shall have shot the plump
partridge, and found her good game, I doubt not.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Although Twm had been preparing himself to give a doughty reply,
and so commence the heroic character he had modelled, yet when
the moment came, his resolution failed him, and the high-sounding
words were not forthcoming; although the determination to disobey
remained as strong as ever.&nbsp; He rode off, through Tregaron,
and up the hills, in a melancholy mood, without any settled
purpose, except that of straightforward resistance to the orders
he had received.&nbsp; As he jogged on listlessly, he was
suddenly roused from his reverie by the braying of
Cadwgan&rsquo;s ass, that was grazing in a green lane, which he
was about to enter.&nbsp; Such an animal being a rarity in the
country, Twm, <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>with surprise, audibly muttered, &ldquo;What the devil
is that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old woman at that moment opening the gate, which she
civilly held for our hero to pass into the lane which she was
leaving, hearing his words, replied, &ldquo;It is only
Cadwgan&rsquo;s <i>ass</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm, whose thoughts ran
entirely on the farmer&rsquo;s fair daughter, mistaking what she
said, rejoined, &ldquo;Cadwgan&rsquo;s <i>lass</i>, did you
say?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are very ready with your mocks and
pranks, Master Twm,&rdquo; cried the old woman, slamming the gate
against the buttocks of the horse, &ldquo;but you know very well
that I said Cadwgan&rsquo;s <i>ass</i>, and not <i>lass</i>! for
I should be very sorry to compare the good and pretty Gwenny
Cadwgan to such an ugly ill-voiced animal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm was
amused at the error he had made, made the good dame the <i>amende
honourable</i>, bade her good day, and rode forward with new
spirits, for this little adventure had furnished him with the
means of deliverance for little Gwenny, and a defeat to his
master&rsquo;s unlawful desires.</p>
<p>The farmer&rsquo;s mind being made up, as before observed, to
refuse the attendance of his daughter at his landlord&rsquo;s, he
was astonished to hear Twm say, &ldquo;Master Cadwgan, it was
Squire Graspacre&rsquo;s order to me, that I should saddle this
horse, come to your house, and, with your consent, bring your
<i>ass</i> to him, on the pillion behind me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cadwgan
stared doubtfully, and Twm resumed, &ldquo;I hope you are too
sensible to question or look into the reasonableness of his
whims, and will be so good as to catch the strange animal, which
I passed on the road, that we may tie him across the
pillion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cadwgan immediately concluded this to be a providential
mistake of the young man&rsquo;s, that might have the most
desirable effect of relieving him from his apprehended trouble,
and with a ready presence of mind said, laughing, &ldquo;To be
sure it is no business of mine to look into the oddness of his
fancies, and he shall have my ass by all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put an L to ass, and &rsquo;twill be
<i>lass</i>,&rdquo; said Twm seriously, and with emphasis,
&ldquo;and such is the squire&rsquo;s <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>demand; but,&rdquo; said the youth
with, rising enthusiasm, &ldquo;I will risk my life to save your
daughter from his snares, and will feign that I thought he said
<i>ass</i> instead of <i>lass</i>, to be brought on the
pillion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Affected by this instance of generosity,
the farmer, as well as his lovely daughter, burst into tears,
thanking and blessing him; whilst the former told him that if he
lost his place through the adventure, his home was always open to
him.&nbsp; Twm was not slow in thanking them for their kindness,
but a smile from Gwenny rewarded him more than anything said, or
anything promised could do.</p>
<p>While Cadwgan went out to catch the long-eared victim, Twm
spent a delicious half-hour in the company of fair Gwenny; and
took that opportunity to protest the ardour of his affection for
her, and vowed that whatever fortune favoured him with the means
of getting a livelihood independent of servitude, it would be the
glory of his life to come and ask her to be his own.&nbsp; The
maiden heard him with streaming eyes and heaving breast, nor
withdrew her cheek when her lover imprinted on it
affection&rsquo;s first kiss; she considered it as a sacred
compact, the seal of a true lover&rsquo;s faithful covenant; one
never to be broken by the intrusion of another.</p>
<p>Cadwgan at length returned, with his charge in a halter,
grumbling and abusing the beast at every step, in consequence of
having led a pretty dance in chase of her.&nbsp; With the
assistance of Twm and a neighbouring cottager, he now tied the
animal&rsquo;s legs and lifted her into the seat of the pillion,
a situation that her struggling and resistance indicated to be
more elevated than comfortable.&nbsp; Twm, however, rode on
slowly with his grotesque companion, without the occurrence of an
accident, till they arrived at Tregaron; when the whole town,
men, women, and children, came to enjoy the strange sight, amidst
roars and shouts of laughter.&nbsp; The ass either was not
comfortable, or she felt her asinine dignity assailed, and <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>therefore
&ldquo;he haw&rsquo;d&rdquo; her disapproval of the
proceedings.&nbsp; She further manifested her displeasure by
making a strong attempt to reach terra firma, eventually thinking
it unjust to make her ride when she was perfectly able and
willing to walk.</p>
<p>Straining every nerve to liberate her captive limbs, she at
length succeeded in breaking the cord by which she was fastened
to the pillion, and tumbled in a heap to the ground, where she
struggled hard, and soon shook off every remnant of her hempen
gyves; and in all the pride of high achievement and newly
acquired freedom, ran with all her might through the town,
brandishing her heels to right and left whenever any person
approached to impede her career, till through a long narrow lane
she reached the mountains.&nbsp; Here she seemed to defy her
numerous pursuers; but after a long chase, which lasted till
dusk, she was surrounded, secured, and placed in her former
situation behind our hero on the pillion.</p>
<p>At length he reached Graspacre Hall, and made his approach at
the back of the house.&nbsp; His step-father assisted him and his
companion to alight, leading the latter to the stable, while Twm
went to inform his master of his arrival, and the cause of his
long delay.&nbsp; A tremor suddenly seemed to paralyze poor Twm,
well knowing the wrath his disappointed master would shower down
upon his devoted head.&nbsp; He mentally thought he should be
thankful to anybody who could liberate him out of this dilemma;
but after his fit of apprehension had lasted a few minutes, he
plucked up his courage and his breeches at the same time,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Well! he can&rsquo;t kill me for it:&rdquo;
and thus self-comforted he entered the house.</p>
<p>The squire at this time was seated at the head of the table,
pushing down the bottle among his friends, principally consisting
of the neighbouring gentry.</p>
<p>In the course of the day he had sent several times to know
whether Twm had arrived.&nbsp; When little Pembroke at length
went in to announce his return, he desired he should be
immediately sent in, and Twm <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>approached him with a burning cheek
and an agitated heart.&nbsp; He questioned him in an undertone,
asking <i>if he had brought her</i>, and where he had been so
long; to which Twm replied, &ldquo;Yes, sir, I have brought her,
and much trouble I had with her, for she didn&rsquo;t like to
come, thinking perhaps you meant her foul play; and once she
escaped off the pillion into the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil she did!&rdquo; cried the squire; &ldquo;but
you caught her again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, sir, after losing much time, I have brought her
at last, and she is now much tamer than at first; and you can do
what you like with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very well,&rdquo; said the squire;
&ldquo;I like the notion that she is very tractable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;ll find she&rsquo;ll do anything now,
though I had to make her know her right position.&nbsp; She
rolled off the pillion in Tregaron, and showed her legs most
dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie! fie!&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;I hope you did
not look at them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, but I did then, and very pretty they
looked.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll be able to give your own opinion,
sir, by and bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good lad, Twm, a good lad, remind me to give you a
golden angel for this day&rsquo;s work; but what have you done
with her? where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; cried Twm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tied her up
to the manger and locked the door, to prevent her
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame, Twm, shame! you ought not to have done that, for
she will think it was by my orders, and hate me perhaps for my
supposed cruelty,&rdquo; quoth the squire, thinking all the time
that Cadwgan&rsquo;s <i>lass</i>, and not his ass was the subject
of discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Twm, &ldquo;but it is likely
though, that she will have an ill-will towards me, as long as she
lives, for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said his master hastily, &ldquo;take
her from the stable into the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, and tell
Margery to comfort her and give her a glass of wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for Twm, and the smothered <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>laugh burst
out in spite of his efforts; on which, his master with a severe
brow, asked how he dared to laugh in his presence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Indeed I could not help it,&rdquo; cried Twm, &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t think she ever drank a glass of wine in her life, and
perhaps might not like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s true; then tell the butler to give
out a bottle of the sweet home-made wine for her&mdash;let it be
a bottle of the cowslip wine, and say that I am very sorry for
the trouble and vexation she has had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; cried Twm, who made his bow and
retired to the servants&rsquo; hall, where he made them
acquainted with the squire&rsquo;s freak of having farmer
Cadwgan&rsquo;s ass brought there on a pillion behind him; and
that it was his master&rsquo;s orders that she was to be brought
into the house-keeper&rsquo;s room, and a glass of wine given to
her, and that Margery was to make her comfortable.</p>
<p>They were all aware of their master&rsquo;s occasional
eccentricities, and that he was as absolute in demanding
obedience to his wildest whims, as to the most important matter
in the world.&nbsp; With one accord they therefore brought the
ass, not without great trouble and opposition on the part of the
poor animal, into the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, where Glamorgan
Margery spread a small carpet for her to lie on, and amidst the
side-aching laughter of the servants, offered a glass of wine,
which no persuasion could induce her to accept.</p>
<p>The squire had given orders that no person was to answer the
bell the rest of the evening but Twm.&nbsp; It was now rung, and
in went our hero, when he was asked, &ldquo;How is she
now?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather fatigued sir; she doesn&rsquo;t
like wine, nor would she touch a drop of it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;if she likes
ale better let her have some, with a cold fowl and something of
the nicest in the house, though perhaps she would prefer a cup of
tea to anything.&nbsp; After she has taken the refreshment she
chooses, tell Margery to put her to bed, in the green chamber,
then lock the door and bring me the key.&nbsp; I can then <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>visit her
when I am ready, you know Twm, and depend upon it I will reward
you in the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Twm&rsquo;s risible
faculties were again oppressed to bursting, but a look from his
master checked him, though he bit his lip till the blood started
in the aid to check his laughter.</p>
<p>Squire Graspacre now secretly anticipated the completion of
his scheme, anxiously waiting for the departure of his guests,
who by their noisy hilarity had long given notice that a little
more devotion to the bottle would lay them under the table.&nbsp;
The wily squire however desisted, before he had passed the
boundary of what topers call <i>half and half</i>, considering in
the mean time, that his plan would best succeed by not appearing
before Gwenny Cadwgan till midnight, when all his household would
be asleep, and himself supposed to have retired to his room.</p>
<p>After some trouble, which was heightened by their forced
suppression of laughter, that however, broke out in spite of
them, the servants got the donkey up stairs, having previously
fed her with bread, oaten cakes, and oats, on her rejection of
ale, wine, fowl, and tea, which to their great amusement they had
successively offered her in vain.&nbsp; Having brought the poor
animal into the green room, the best chamber in the house, and
kept only for particular guests, they placed her on the fine
handsome bed; the legs being already tied, they fastened them
also to the bed-posts.&nbsp; Twm heightened the drollery of the
scene by cutting two holes in a night-cap, drawing through the
donkey&rsquo;s ears, and slitting it at the edge, he drew the cap
down carefully towards the eyes.&nbsp; The bed-clothes were then
carefully drawn up to the ass&rsquo;s neck, the curtains half
drawn, and the first ass that ever slept in a feather bed was
then left to enjoy its slumbers as best it could.&nbsp; They bade
her good night, locked the door, and gave the key to their
master.</p>
<p>The guests at length dispersing, they all rode off as well as
their muddled heads would let them, to their respective homes;
the squire, as was his custom, <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>locked the door himself, and saw
every light in the house out before he retired.&nbsp; At length
he gained his chamber, and all was still in Graspacre-Hall.&nbsp;
The amorous squire, chuckling at his luck as he thought of the
fair lass in the green-room, grew too impatient to wait till the
proposed hour of midnight, and leaving his candle on his own
table, took off his shoes, and softly approached the casket that
he deemed contained his precious jewel.</p>
<p>Applying the key, he opened the door very gently, and
cautiously approaching the side of the bed, said in a whisper
towards the pillow, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, Gwenny, my
dear, &rsquo;tis I, the squire; fear nothing, my girl, this will
be the making of your fortune, my dear; and if you are as kind
and loving as I could wish you to be, you may soon become the
second Mrs. Graspacre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing no reply, he considered that according to the old
usage, <i>silence gives consent</i>, and proceeded to bend his
face down to kiss the fair one, when a severe bounce inflicted by
his <i>incognita&rsquo;s</i> snout, knocked him backwards off the
bed to the floor, and set his nose a-bleeding.</p>
<p>After recovering himself a little, though labouring under the
delusion that the blow had been struck by the hand of the fair
maiden, he exclaimed in an under-tone, &ldquo;You little wixen!
how dare you treat me in this manner?&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer
received was a loud and repeated &ldquo;he-haw,&rdquo; with the
clattering of hoofs against the bedposts.&nbsp; Now hoofs are
suggestive, and the squire rather believed in the
supernatural.&nbsp; He again proceeded towards the bed, but was
completely horror-struck at the loud bray which the terrified ass
sent forth; while the poor terrified animal, after a hard
struggle, liberating her limbs, struck him a severe blow on the
forehead with her hoof, and getting off the bed, made a terrible
clatter with her shod feet over the boards of the room.&nbsp; The
unfortunate squire, although hitherto a loud decrier of
superstition, now felt a thrill of the utmost horror pervade him,
while he decreed himself ensnared by <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>the enemy of man, as the punishment
of his guilty intentions; and after a clamorous outcry fell
senseless on the floor.</p>
<p>The servants having but concealed the light, expecting some
<i>denouement</i> of this sort, now rushed in, and saw their
fallen master ghastly pale, with streams of perspiration running
over his forehead, while his wildly-staring eyes alternately
looked at, and turned from, the monster of alarm.&nbsp; When he
had sufficiently recovered to learn the real state of affairs,
from little Pembroke, who had been made Twm&rsquo;s confidante in
this matter&mdash;how that wight had brought the farmer&rsquo;s
ass according to his orders behind him on the pillion, although
he had been in some doubt whether he had said Cadwgan&rsquo;s
<i>ass</i> or Cadwgan&rsquo;s <i>lass</i>, the squire&rsquo;s
rage was boundless.</p>
<p>Squire Graspacre&rsquo;s rage can be better imagined than
described, and all the dormant fiends of evil were at once
awakened in his bosom, and the feeling which first actuated him
was that of revenge upon Twm, and secondly shame at having been
duped, and that with the knowledge of all his household.&nbsp;
Exasperated at the trick put upon him by a mere youngster, and a
menial, and scarcely less provoked at the exposure he had made of
himself before his servants, down he rushed into the hall, and
snatched a heavy horsewhip, unlocked the door, and made his way
towards our hero&rsquo;s chamber over the laundry; but when he
reached the bedside, prepared to inflict the severest punishment
that the thong of a whip was capable of, how great was his
mortification to find the bird had flown!&nbsp; His chagrin and
resentment were anything but lessened, when he took a piece of
paper off the bed, on which, in a large hand, were written these
pretty lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>If from lass you take the letter L.<br />
Then lass is ass if I have learnt to spell;<br />
Yes ass and lass methinks are coupled ill.<br />
Though human asses follow lasses still!<br />
An ass were I too&mdash;could I so arrange ill,<br />
If now I stay&rsquo;d to claim my promised angel.</p>
</blockquote>

124</span>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> finds that his
father-in-law is as churlish as ever, but Carmarthen Jack comes
to grief in consequence.&nbsp; The Squire turns reformer.&nbsp;
His children arrive at the hall.&nbsp; A tender Devonian.&nbsp;
Twm satirizes the cook.&nbsp; Thrashes the young squire, and then
&ldquo;disappears.&rdquo;&nbsp; Calls upon Cadwgan and
Rhys.&nbsp; An adventure on the hills.</p>
<p>Twm reached his mother&rsquo;s at Tregaron about one
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and alarmed her greatly by the
account he gave of his flight from the squire&rsquo;s, and the
cause which led to it.&nbsp; Jack consoled poor Catty by assuring
her that her son would go to the devil, and that ruin would come
upon them through his tricks, to a certainty.&nbsp; Number one
again, as the reader will see, with very little affection for his
wife&rsquo;s offspring.&nbsp; It is a selfish world, and Jack did
as Rome did, none the less eagerly because it always suited his
own convenience.&nbsp; He concluded by saying that they ought to
turn poor Twm adrift, and leave him to himself in order to
conciliate the squire.&nbsp; While Jack beneath the bed-clothes,
was grunting these suggestions of worldly wisdom, Catty
half-dressed, was sitting dejectedly in the chimney corner.</p>
<p>Having caught the drift of his father-in-law&rsquo;s
mutterings, he rose abruptly, snatched up his hat, and while
striding to the door, cried, &ldquo;Good night,
mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alarmed at his precipitate movement, and the
tone in which he spoke,&mdash;&ldquo;Where are you going,
Twm?&rdquo; said Catty.&nbsp; Turning around, while he held the
door in his left hand, he replied, &ldquo;Anywhere
mother&mdash;the world is wide&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll go headlong
to the devil, rather than stay here, where I am not
welcome.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that he closed the door, and was in a
moment out of sight, notwithstanding the cries and entreaties of
his mother, who ran after, and earnestly sought to bring him
back.</p>
<p>Catty, with a bitter conscience, now found that <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>her son had
a step-father, and she a husband, who was a rude and churlish
tyrant.&nbsp; To give him his due, Jack was far from being
regardless of her sorrow, but showed the tenderness of a husband
in comforting her, in a manner most natural to himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What signifies crying for such an imp of a devil as
that?&rdquo; said this kind step-father: &ldquo;if he starves in
the field by being out to-night, it will save him from dying at
the gallows, where he would be sure to come some day or
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This tender-hearted speech had the unexpected effect of
immediately curing Catty&rsquo;s grief, which turned to a
desperate fit of rage, and without a word to signify the
transition wrought by his oratory, she snatched up a stout
broom-stick from the floor, and be-laboured him with all her
strength, as he lay beneath the bed-clothes, till he roared like
a baited bull.&nbsp; When the strength of her arm failed, the
energy of her tongue commenced; and after rating him soundly, she
concluded her harangue with eloquent pithiness, hoping that she
had left him a shirtful of bones; and expressing a devout hope
that he would eventually arrive at that elevated position in
society which he had described as the probable fate of her
darling son.&nbsp; After which exertion and speechifying, she
thought proper to disappear.</p>
<p>Jack, although he received some hard blows, by dodging under
the bed-clothes, escaped better than his help-mate intended he
should; he soon rose, dressed himself and went to his
master&rsquo;s sauntering sullenly about the outhouses till
daylight, when a servant informed him, after narrating
Twm&rsquo;s trick on his master, that he was to take
Cadwgan&rsquo;s ass home.</p>
<p>Squire Graspacre, since the death of his wife, gave such free
range to his licentious pleasures, as placed him, especially at
his years, in a most unseemly light.&nbsp; His only son had been
two years at Oxford, returning only occasionally during the
vacations; while his two daughters on the death of their mother,
were sent to a boarding-school at Exeter.&nbsp; Thus in his own
family he had no witnesses of his vices and follies.&nbsp; <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>He soon
found, however, that in Wales, his offences against religion and
morality were not to be committed with impunity.&nbsp; The
respect in which he was formerly held by the country people
gradually declined, while those who had daughters became
extremely shy, and sent their female inmates out of the way
whenever he approached.</p>
<p>The squire was not slow to discover these changes, and all the
pride of his nature, that pride which loved ambition and power,
which demanded implicit obedience, and loved to sway the sceptre
of power, had aroused him within; determined to subdue the
glaring insolence, as he deemed it, of his neighbours.&nbsp;
Never deficient in penetration, he was not long in discovering
this change in the bearings of his tenants and neighbours, which
to a mind like his, proud, fond of domineering, and being looked
up to as the superior&mdash;the grand central luminary of his
sphere, round which all others moved as silent and respectful
satellites&mdash;was a very hell.</p>
<p>The minds of men, however, are not to be overruled, and with a
wisdom rare as effective, he immediately resolved, as the only
mode of re-establishing his credit and happiness, to retrace his
steps&mdash;to which end he sent for his daughters home, at a
time when his son was about to return from Oxford&mdash;and thus,
by the presence of his children, place a restrictive guard upon
his future conduct.&nbsp; With this change in his ideas, it will
be no wonder that Twm Shon Catty was again taken into favour, and
replaced in his former situation.</p>
<p>At length the merry bells of Tregaron announced the arrival of
the heir, and the young ladies of Graspacre Hall, which mansion
soon became a scene of festivity.&nbsp; The meeting of the squire
with his daughters was ardently affectionate; but his son
Marmaduke had nothing of cordiality in his nature.&nbsp; His
figure was tall and thin, with loose joints and ill-knit bones,
while his countenance indicated both phlegm, and a fidgetty,
nervous peevishness.&nbsp; He bore the marks of late and <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>dissipated
hours upon his countenance.&nbsp; His face was sallow, and his
eyes sunken; he had the unmistakable air and <i>tout ensemble</i>
of a rou&egrave; and a libertine.</p>
<p>He was by no means prepossessing, whilst his pride and
self-sufficiency made him an object of dislike to all who
approached him.&nbsp; He scrupled not to say openly that he hated
Wales and Welshmen.&nbsp; He condescended, however, to say, that
until he could get a clever English servant, in the place of the
last, who ran away from him, he must put up with one of the Welsh
savages.&nbsp; Accordingly, our hero was appointed to be his
temporary valet, and ordered to attend exclusively on the young
squire.</p>
<p>With the ladies came their aunt, the squire&rsquo;s younger
sister, a very affected fantastical spinster from Exeter; who
gave every fashion its Devonshire latitude in her conformation to
it, carrying the mode to an extreme that left London absurdity
far in the back-ground.&nbsp; The Misses Graspacre were neither
imitators nor very ardent admirers of their aunt, whose silly
affectation of excessive delicacy became their standing-point of
ridicule, which they put in practice on the evening of their
arrival.</p>
<p>The hearty girls wanted something substantial for their
supper, after travelling their long journey; but their aunt
intimated her desire to have something that would be light upon
the stomach.&nbsp; The poet expresses the old lady&rsquo;s
opinion when he wrote in homely phrases:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sup on dainty calf-foot jelly,<br />
Never sleep with well-filled belly;<br />
Sup upon the lightest food,<br />
Rice; or anything that&rsquo;s good.<br />
Mind you never eat cold meat!<br />
If you&rsquo;d sleep, that is no treat!<br />
The nightmare black you&rsquo;ll have, be sure!<br />
But suppers light are just the cure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But great was the aunt&rsquo;s dismay on finding a duck and
green peas brought to the table.&nbsp; She resolved, however,
even on this fare, to show her superior Devonshire <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>breeding;
and while the young ladies lifted their peas from their plates to
their mouths in half-dozens or more at a time, she, delicate
soul, cut every pea in four, and swallowed a quarter at a
time!</p>
<p>Another circumstance of note happened at this supper, which,
as it relates to our hero, must be told.&nbsp; It seems that
during Twm&rsquo;s disgrace, and consequent absence from the
hall, the servants there indulged themselves in making remarks on
his conduct, and its probable consequence.&nbsp; This discussion
displayed their various dispositions.&nbsp; Some spoke of him
with charity, and dwelt upon his rare qualities of good nature
and cheerfulness; while others took a malignant pleasure in
speaking of his satirical and mischievous propensities.&nbsp;
Among the latter was the cook.&nbsp; Twm, on his return, heard of
her <i>kindness</i>, and determined to take the first opportunity
of showing his sense of the obligations she had laid him
under.&nbsp; On the removal of the remains of the duck and its
accompaniments, the company having just been helped round with
tart or pie, their attention was suddenly arrested by the voice
of Twm in the passage, who loudly sung the following
distich:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Apple pie is very rich,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so is venison pasty;<br />
But then our cook has got the itch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is very nasty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ye gods! what sounds for ears polite!&nbsp; The young ladies
laughed immoderately on perceiving the distress of their aunt,
who showed a wry-faced consciousness of having partaken food
prepared by unclean hands; her countenance underwent various
contortions, and she mentally thought of the old proverb about
the obligatory rule set down upon each member of humanity, that
we must all eat a peck of dirt in our lifetime, but she devoutly
hoped that all her share was not to be eaten at one meal.&nbsp;
Those awful thoughts had a tragic ending, for they terminated in
the grand climax of a shriek and a fit.&nbsp; The squire&rsquo;s
anger was instantly kindled against Twm, probably from an
unquenched spark <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>of his former resentment, which he evinced by telling
his son to &ldquo;give that rascal a good thrashing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proud of his commission, out ran Marmaduke; and finding Twm in
the hall, ran up and struck him a blow in the face; but great was
the amazement of the servants to see the young man turn upon him
like a lion, and with the most dexterous management of his fists
overpowering their young master in an instant, whom he left
groaning with pain, and covered with bruises, and then made a
precipitate retreat.</p>
<p>While walking to Tregaron, it occurred to Twm, that for that
night at least, he should be favoured with a lodging by his
constant friend, Rhys, the curate.&nbsp; Thither he went, and
found the worthy man by the parlour fire, with a book in his
hand, and papers before him, busily employed in preparing for the
press a new edition of his Welsh Grammar.&nbsp; He was received
by him with his usual kindness; and when Twm told him his tale,
with the important addition that he must leave his native place
for ever, and that immediately, he showed the goodness of his
heart by assuring him of a retreat for the present, and a little
pecuniary aid on his departure.&nbsp; He however gave him a
friendly lecture on the impropriety of his conduct; observing
that if he must be satirical, he ought to choose the subject for
his lash from the famous among the great and wealthy, and not the
puny and defenceless, to attack whom, he said, evinced a paltry
and most dastardly spirit; concluding with the pithy injunction,
&ldquo;while you live, whatever your state while on earth, act
the generous and manly part; and never, never, either manually,
or with the lash of satire, war with the weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words formed in a great measure the leading rule in
Twm&rsquo;s after life.&nbsp; He never forgot them, and all the
more because they came from the lips of one whom he revered and
loved; and however reprehensible the after vagaries of
Twm&rsquo;s life may have been, their harsher features were
considerably modified by the remembrance of the words, &ldquo;War
not against the <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>weak!&rdquo;&nbsp; Our hero was heartily pleased with
his preceptor, inasmuch, that amidst all his observations and
lectures he imputed to him but slight blame for his retaliation
on young Graspacre; but when he vowed further vengeance, should
he ever meet him alone in the mountains remonstrated with him on
the risk he ran, urged the necessity of self-preservation, and
advised him not to endanger himself needlessly.</p>
<p>The next morning Rhys assured Twm that he had reflected on the
peculiarity of his case, and found it by no means so bad as he
had imagined.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to leaving this place,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I see no necessity; merely keep out of the way awhile,
and in due time make your submissions to the squire; as he is by
no means a hard man, I have no doubt but all will speedily be
well again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm adopted this idea, though he
ill-stomached the thought of submission, or of asking pardon for
an act of manliness which he would on a similar case of
aggravation repeat.</p>
<p>Thus matters rested for the present; and in the dusk of the
evening he crossed the hills towards Cadwgan&rsquo;s, and soon
had the grateful satisfaction of seeing once more his beauteous
mistress, sitting by her father before a cheerful fire.&nbsp; Her
mild kind face was unusually pale, but brightened on his
approach; and when he related his new mishap, and that he thought
of immediately quitting the country in consequence, her cheek
assumed an ashy paleness, and she nearly fainted in her
father&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Cadwgan dissuaded him from the thought
of quitting his native place for such a trifle, and advised him
by all means to follow up the worthy curate&rsquo;s suggestion;
and when the fair Gwenny repeated her father&rsquo;s wishes as
her own, Twm at once acquiesced, and resolved not to quit.</p>
<p>Thus time passed on pleasantly, for some days, when our hero
said he longed exceedingly for a day&rsquo;s coursing on the
neighbouring mountains.&nbsp; Cadwgan remarked that the squire
had shown no desire to pursue him, as he had heard at Tregaron
and he conceived <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>there would be no danger; and so in accordance with his
opinion, he lent him his dog and gun, both great favourites, and
never before entrusted to any one breathing.&nbsp; He advised him
to confine his excursion to a certain remote hill called Twyn Du
(<i>Black Hill</i>) which being rugged of ascent and marshy,
seldom invited the steps of the sons of pleasure in the character
of sportsmen.</p>
<p>Thus with dog and gun, and accoutred with a shot-belt, our
hero felt himself another and superior being to what he had ever
been before, especially as Gwenny assured him that the
sportsman&rsquo;s paraphernalia became him exceedingly.&nbsp; He
shook Cadwgan&rsquo;s hand, kissed the lips of his fair mistress,
and gallantly sallied forth.&nbsp; Having gone a few yards, he
turned his face back to assure them, that he should return and
well loaded with game.</p>
<p>Twm enjoyed himself thoroughly.&nbsp; There was a complete
sense of freedom and independence in his sport which more than
pleased him; with light heart, cool head, and steady aim, he
brought down bird after bird, filling his bag, and carolling old
Welsh airs the while.&nbsp; He had been on Twyn Du about an hour
and a half, and in that time had killed several birds, when the
report of his gun attracted others to the spot.&nbsp; He could
hear several persons on the hill contiguous, and saw one well
mounted, descending into the deep dingle that, like a gulf,
yawned between the two hills, and making his way up the steep
side of Twyn Du.</p>
<p>He now felt a presentiment that this visit portended him no
good; but scorning an ignominious flight, he carelessly paced the
brow of the hill till the sportsman approached, when, to his
great amazement, who should present himself before him but his
inveterate foe, Marmaduke Graspacre.&nbsp; He approached Twm with
the fury of a demoniac, asking how he dared fire a gun on those
grounds, and after a few harsh words of abuse, which our hero
returned with interest, he took an aim at Cadwgan&rsquo;s
pointer, and instantly shot him on the spot.</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>This
butcherly, cowardly act, aroused the indignation of our
hero.&nbsp; He felt his Welsh blood course madly through his
veins.&nbsp; The thought too, that this was Cadwgan&rsquo;s dog,
his favourite pointer, the animal petted and nursed by his own
sweet Gwenny, drove Twm furious, and he was further aggravated by
the young squire demanding his gun, and laughing the while at his
distress and rage.&nbsp; The youth was not formed of stuff so
tame as to endure his insolent triumph.&nbsp; Snatching up his
loaded gun with desperate rapidity, he in a moment lodged the
contents in the head of the squire&rsquo;s fine hunter, on which
his enemy sat taunting him.&nbsp; No sooner had Marmaduke reached
the ground, disengaged himself from his fallen horse, and stood
up, than Twm flew at him, and disregarding his threats, with his
dexterous fists inflicted the most perfect chastisement; leaving
him in a far worse predicament than after their first
encounter.</p>
<p>By this time the men who attended the young squire, hearing
the report of the guns, and fearing that their young master had
fallen in with poachers, made best of their way down across the
dingle, and up the sides of Twyn Du.</p>
<p>Roused by their shouts, Twm left his vanquished foe groaning
on the ground by the side of the dead hunter, and darting down
the opposite side he made a safe retreat.&nbsp; This was an
adventure which constituted the turning point of our hero&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; The magnitude of the consequences it involved, he
scarcely dreamt of at that moment.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> is
&ldquo;wanted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hides himself in a wood.&nbsp; Love
takes him to Cadwgan&rsquo;s house, where he is welcomed.&nbsp;
Parson Evans acting as &ldquo;detector.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm escapes
in the disguise of a female.&nbsp; Affectionate parting with the
farmer and Gwenny.</p>
<p>No sooner was Marmaduke Graspacre taken home, and the affair
made known by him to his father, with some little exaggeration
against the assailant, such as the trifling mis-statement that
the blows inflicted on him were by the butt-end of the
fowling-piece, instead of the fist, than the squire&rsquo;s
indignation was roused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As this is not the first offence, and my forbearance
has encouraged his atrocious conduct, I am now determined to make
an example of him,&rdquo; said he, and immediately sent a servant
for Parson Evans, who, in the capacity of magistrate, was ordered
to take cognizance of the affair, and send constables in all
directions to arrest the culprit.&nbsp; This was an office that
well accorded with this malignant man; he had not the generosity
enough to forget and forgive the follies of youth; and had a
bloodhound been set upon Twm&rsquo;s track, he would not have
scented him out with more pleasure than Parson Evans.</p>
<p>The hue and cry instantly was raised and spread abroad, and
excited as great a commotion throughout the country as if a
convicted murderer were chased through the land.&nbsp; All
Twm&rsquo;s haunts were searched, especially his mother&rsquo;s
and farmer Cadwgan&rsquo;s; in each of which places there was
heaviness and wailing for his misfortunes; and Parson Evans, who
went there in person, took care to assure them, that when caught,
all the world could not save him from the gallows, as he had
attempted to murder the young squire of Graspacre-Hall.</p>
<p>But with all the vigilance of his enemies, Twm&rsquo;s retreat
remained undiscovered and those who were <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>friendly
disposed towards him began to wonder among themselves what had
become of him.&nbsp; Some thought that, in a fit of despondency,
he had drowned himself; and others, that he had escaped into the
neighbouring counties of Pembroke, Carmarthen, or Brecon; or that
he had shipped himself in some vessel at Aberayon, or
Aberystwyth, and got off in safety.&nbsp; The constables,
however, had visited each of these places, and at length returned
without any further intelligence than that their journey had been
in vain.</p>
<p>While the search was most hot, our hero concealed himself in a
small patch of marshy underwood, a spot on which the keen eye of
suspicion never glanced, his pursuers having passed the edge of
it many times without a thought occurring of seeking him
there.&nbsp; In this retreat he fed himself on nuts and
blackberries, and in the night roved about for recreation, but
returned to his green-wood shelter before day-light.&nbsp; Even
here, Twm&rsquo;s love of mischief was as prominent as ever.</p>
<p>One night, while the moon gave a good light, he found a large
deep hole, close by his retreat.&nbsp; Knowing that his pursuers
would very probably pass that way shortly, he covered over the
opening with sticks and a thin layer of earth and leaves.&nbsp;
Presently came Parson Evans, who had separated himself from the
rest of the searchers, and coming to the trap, immediately sunk
over-head, to the depth of twelve feet, giving a wild and very
unparsonic yell as he descended.&nbsp; He bawled loudly for help,
but Twm bounded from his retreat, and shouting down the hole,
&ldquo;Ha! ha!&nbsp; Evans the fox is trapped at last,&rdquo;
made best of his way to another part of the forest.</p>
<p>His concealment and life in the woods continued four days,
when, exceedingly tired of his solitude, he one midnight ventured
to Cadwgan&rsquo;s door, and both surprised and gratified the
farmer and his kinder daughter, when they heard the lost
one&rsquo;s voice once more.&nbsp; They rose and let him in
immediately, made a fire, gave every necessary refreshment, and
then persuaded him to go to bed.</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>Twm
remained hidden here a week, when suspicion fixed upon
Cadwgan&rsquo;s house, although searched before, as the probable
place of concealment.&nbsp; One day, Gwenny ran in a fright to
tell her father to conceal Twm immediately, as the constables,
headed by Parson Evans, were coming.&nbsp; Twm started up and
said, &ldquo;Bolt the door for ten minutes, and I shall be
safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gwenny replied that they could not be there in
that time, as they were then descending the opposite side of the
Cwm, which was three long fields off, and that they approached
slowly, with fox-like cunning, so as to excite no suspicion of
their purpose.</p>
<p>With that, at Twm&rsquo;s request, they both went up stairs
with him, for a purpose which he said he was there to explain to
them, as neither of them could conceive in what manner he was
going to preserve himself.&nbsp; They all remained above
&rsquo;till the loud summons of authority, in the raven voice of
old Evans, brought Cadwgan down, when the cleric magistrate told
him, in no gentle terms, that there was a suspicion attached to
his house, as the place where the young villain, Twm Shon Catty,
was concealed.</p>
<p>The farmer replied, &ldquo;I must say this is very hard usage,
as I have no one with me but my daughter and my eldest sister,
who has come on a few weeks&rsquo; visit; but, as you are come,
you may search in welcome.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a brief scrutiny
below, they all went up stairs, where sat, busily employed at
their needles, the fair Gwenny Cadwgan and the ingenious Twm Shon
Catty, excellently disguised in the dress of Cadwgan&rsquo;s late
wife; which having been the property of a tall women fitted him
very well.&nbsp; His face was slightly coloured with the juice of
blackberries; beneath his chin was pinned a dowdyish cap, which
in the scant light of a small window, by the aid of a pair of
spectacles he appeared a complete old granny.</p>
<p>On the entrance of these amiable visitors, he turned his full
spectacled face on Parson Evans, muttering, in the tone of an old
woman, which he mimicked well, &ldquo;lack a day! lack a day!
this is sad usage;&rdquo; <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>then whispered Gwenny, who took the
hint, and, while they were searching, laid some hog&rsquo;s lard
on different parts of the stairs, so that, on their descent, the
precious party, with their rascally leader, slipped and fell
headlong down from top to bottom, to the great amusement of those
above.&nbsp; On being charged with this contrivance, each denied
all knowledge of, and the quick witted Gwenny accounted for the
cause of their accident by saying that they had been carrying
butter and lard to the store, up stairs, the whole morning.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Twm emptied the contents of a certain
piece of crockery upon the devoted heads of the searchers, just
as they emerged from the doorway, and when he discovered the
splutterings and surprise manifested by the parson, shouted down
from the upper window, &ldquo;Dear! dear!&nbsp; I thought you
lazy folk would be half a mile from the house before now.&nbsp;
Well well! ye&rsquo;ll get a washing for nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The parson muttered something very like a curse, while the
constables &ldquo;d&mdash;d&rdquo; the old woman
unceremoniously.</p>
<p>They were no sooner gone than Twm assured Cadwgan that he saw
there was no safety for him except in flight, which must take
place that very night.&nbsp; His plan, he said, was matured, that
he had no fear but he should do well, and that his only regret
was in parting with them.&nbsp; He purposed, he said, to make his
way towards Carmarthenshire, or perhaps farther and seek
employment among the farmers; or, what was more agreeable to him,
he might, perhaps, get to some village where he could set up a
school; so that after saving a sum of money to begin life with,
he should return and make Gwenny his wife.&nbsp; With tearful
eyes Cadwgan expressed his admiration of his plan, while poor
Gwenny wept herself almost into fits, at the thought of his
perils, and sudden departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, my boy, thou shalt not go penniless to
wander the wide world,&rdquo; said Cadwgan, and put an old
pocket-book, containing several angels, and near twenty shillings
in silver, which Twm reluctantly took, <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>promising
its return doubly when fortune favoured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
two favours more to ask,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the first is,
that you will make the best of my affair when you tell my poor
mother and the worthy Mr. Rhys of my flight, and my future plans
in life; and my next request is, that you will give me this old
woman&rsquo;s dress, with the red cloak belonging to it, as it
will answer for a disguise should I be troubled before I get far
enough off.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cadwgan kindly acquiesced, though he
smiled at the latter whimsical fancy.&nbsp; At length, thus
attired to avoid observation, with his own clothes in a bundle,
he took an affecting leave of them, and made a hasty departure
from their friendly door.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> risks another
visit to Tregaron.&nbsp; Alarms his friend Watt.&nbsp; Danger of
betrayal by him.&nbsp; His cunning is more than a match for Watt,
Parson Evans, and his wife.&nbsp; Escapes, and with a good
booty.&nbsp; Disappearance of the Parson&rsquo;s horse, great
coat, and cash.</p>
<p>It was a dull heavy night, in which fog and darkness contended
for precedence, and the moon gleamed as if about to retire
altogether, when Twm Shon Catty shaped his course over the
mountain, in the direction which led to Lampeter; he looked
instinctively towards his dear native town, which a fashionable
tourist would perhaps have called the most wretched village in
the universe; but, to him, it was full of sweet associations, and
recollections the most agreeable; the scene of his childhood, the
home of his mother:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear to all their natal spot,<br />
Although &rsquo;twere Nature&rsquo;s foulest blot;<br />
For, wherever we may roam,<br />
There&rsquo;s ne&rsquo;er a place like Home, sweet Home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He stopped, and looked wistfully towards Tregaron; <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>the lights
were glistening in their various humble casements, and he fancied
that among them all he could distinguish his
mother&rsquo;s&mdash;his kind fond mother&rsquo;s&mdash;whom,
perhaps, he was never to see again,&mdash;and now he recollected
many instances of her tenderness, which had long slumbered in his
recollection.&nbsp; His eyes filled with tears, and the softness
of his heart was put at once into mournful harmony.</p>
<p>A sudden thought, no less eccentric than daring, now took him,
that thus disguised, he might safely pass through Tregaron, and
perhaps see his mother before his departure.&nbsp; This idea was
no sooner started than acted upon; and, before an hour had
expired, he found himself once more in the long and almost only
street in Tregaron.&nbsp; He met two or three old women whom he
knew well, but there was no recognition on their part, only a
long, vacant stare of astonishment, no doubt wondering who the
stranger could be, venturing into Tregaron at that late
hour.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s door was closed for the night, and
he durst not call to her, as Jack was not to be trusted.&nbsp; He
moved on, looking earnestly to every door.&nbsp; The whole street
seemed still as death, except that various snores, here and
there, reminded Twm of the sweet sleep enjoyed by others though
denied to him; while the stray villagers whom he had met were
busy locking their doors, or barring them with the wooden
sash.</p>
<p>He sauntered slowly along, meditating on the circumstance that
made him afraid to face those who knew him, till opposite to the
cottage of his old companion and elder brother in mischief, Watt
the mole-catcher.&nbsp; Watt had long lived with a widowed
mother, who had recently died, and now sojourned alone in her
solitary hut; it was even reported that he had forsaken all his
wicked ways, grown serious, and was consequently likely to do
well.&nbsp; It occurred to Twm that he had often heard Watt deny
the existence of ghosts and hobgoblins, and vaunt that nothing of
that description could in the least frighten him; and now,
thought Twm, I&rsquo;ll put his courage to the trial.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Peeping through the casement, he saw Watt in bed, at
the farther end of the cottage, and the fire burning through the
peat heaped up to preserve it for the night, so that the white
walls within were brightened by the gleams cast on them from the
hearth.&nbsp; Softly lifting the latch, he opened the door,
entered, and, walking quietly towards the hearth, sat on the
three-legged stool, took up the old snoutless bellows, and began
blowing the fire with all his might.&nbsp; Watt awoke in extreme
terror, and seeing the figure of a tall woman in the chimney
corner, deeming it no other than his mother&rsquo;s spirit, his
fright increased.</p>
<p>Trembling and almost dissolved in perspiration, he at last
burst out into a roar of &ldquo;Lord have mercy on me! oh,
mother&rsquo;s dear spirit, pity me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm laughed
out, and ran to his bed-side to stop his roaring cries,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Silence, man, &rsquo;tis I, Twm, your old
friend, Twm Shon Catty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Watt slowly awoke to the
consciousness that his theory did not stand the test of practice,
and that this had been proven by one who had often heard him
vaunting as to his fearlessness of the supernatural.</p>
<p>Convinced of his identity, and having heard our hero&rsquo;s
story, he said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twere better you were at the bottom
of a river, Twm, than here, for I have been compelled, by Parson
Evans, to make an oath that if you came here, I would immediately
either send or run myself to inform him of your arrival; and I
can&rsquo;t break, an oath, Twm, for anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not think,&rdquo; said our hero coolly,
&ldquo;that you, who have broken so many laws, would scruple much
about breaking a forced oath; but old companionship pleads
weakly, opposed to the reward that will be given for my
apprehension; I thought, though the whole town were to turn
against me that you, Watt would have been my friend, for you have
led me into many troubles, and I never laid a jot of blame to
your charge, but took all to myself, and have often suffered on
your account.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Watt,
who by this time had nearly dressed himself, was much affected by
this appeal, and said, &ldquo;No, Twm, I will never betray you,
but, if I were known in the least to favour you it would ruin all
my hopes of success in life.&nbsp; I am, next week, to be married
to Betsy Gwevelheer, <a name="citation140"></a><a
href="#footnote140" class="citation">[140]</a> Parson
Evan&rsquo;s maid that I have courted these ten years; and the
parson has promised to do great things at the bidding: and more
than that, I am to be the parish clerk and grave-digger when old
Morgan Meredith dies, and he can&rsquo;t live long, as I have
made him a present of a good church-yard cough, by breaking a
hole in the thatch over his bed, by which he has gained a great
hoarseness, and nearly lost his voice; so that I expect to be
called in to officiate for him next Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are still my friend,&rdquo; said Twm, who had
been lost in a reverie during part of Watt&rsquo;s remarks,
&ldquo;and I give you joy of your fair prospects, which I would
not destroy on any account; you shall serve me, and, at the same
time keep your oath.&nbsp; You know my talent at mimicry, and see
how well this dress becomes me; aye, I become the dress equally
as you shall see.&nbsp; Had I not already disclosed myself, I
could have discoursed to you a whole hour at mid-day, fearless of
a discovery; but let us see how this cloak becomes you,
Watt.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that he took off the cloak and put it on
Watt, and, after a little jesting on the subject, Twm suddenly
exclaimed, &ldquo;Only sit down here with the cloak on your
shoulders for ten minutes, while I step out, and, with the
assistance of my bundle, I will astonish you with my
transformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was uttered with the gay rapidity of an anticipated
freak, and Watt taken by surprise, immediately acquiesced,
without knowing what he was about.&nbsp; Twm ran immediately to
the Rectory House, and making a great clatter, roused Parson
Evans, who opened the window and asked what was the matter; when,
assuming Watt&rsquo;s voice, he said hastily, &ldquo;Mister
Evans!&nbsp; Mister Evans!&nbsp; Twm Shon Catty is now in my
cottage, <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>dressed in a cloak, and sitting at the fire.&nbsp; You
had best be quick and secure him.&nbsp; He wanted me not to
betray him, but I could not break my oath, you know; so pray you,
Parson, make haste if you would have your desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delighted with this intelligence, Evans awakened the whole
house, especially two strapping fellows, whom he called his
bull-dogs, sometimes employing them as husbandry servants, at
others, on account of their large size, and muscular power, as
constables.&nbsp; Both these fellows were first sent to saddle
his horse, in case he should have to take Twm to Cardigan
gaol,&mdash;and then to attend him to Watt&rsquo;s cottage, where
the trio soon went.</p>
<p>Peeping through the casement, Evans discovered a tall figure
wrapped in a cloak, as described.&nbsp; &ldquo;There he is sure
enough,&rdquo; quoth he in a whisper; &ldquo;now get your cords
ready for binding his hands, and stay here till I call you in; be
sure that you watch the door well.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that he
lifted the latch and went in.&nbsp; Watt, who, in the interim of
our hero&rsquo;s absence, had made up a good fire, now stood up,
and, as he saw the clerical magistrate before him, exclaimed,
&ldquo;Well done, Twm, my boy!&nbsp; I now give you credit; well,
well, well, this is indeed strange; a wonderful disguise; you
look the old rascal to the life; if you had not told me
before-hand of your intended transformation, I could have sworn
you were old Evans himself; you look now just as he did when he
promised to make me parish clerk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evans remained petrified with astonishment till the last words
were uttered, when he replied, &ldquo;Parish devil! you infernal
scoundrel, have you roused me out of my bed at midnight to hoax
and insult me in this manner? but you shall dearly repent your
insolence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watt stared with wonder, and replied, &ldquo;Well, well,
well!&nbsp; I never did hear such a thing in my life; you have
just the old villain&rsquo;s voice and swaggering way; I wish I
may die if you don&rsquo;t so frighten me; and I <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>could
almost swear the spiteful old Evans himself stood before me; hang
him, I hate his very looks, and I am only holding a candle to the
devil, in hopes of the parish clerkship, by seeming so civil to
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evans thought him certainly either mad or
drunk; and without any further explanation, he called the two men
in, and ordered them to secure him.&nbsp; The light at length
broke in on Watt&rsquo;s mind; Twm&rsquo;s trick on him, and the
real state of the case appeared; and he struggled hard before the
fellows could secure him.</p>
<p>At length he cleared up his confused and chagrined
countenance, and said, in an undaunted tone, &ldquo;Well, well,
well, I see the worst; farewell to mole-catching; farewell to
parish-clerkship, and Bessy Gwevelheer; and you, you evil-minded
old scourge, may bid farewell to all hopes of having me to father
your brat, of which your maid Bessy is big.&nbsp; I will make the
country ring with the stories of your rascalities if you dare to
send me to the round house; but if you liberate me at once, I
shall leave Tregaron for ever, in the course of a few days, and
go abroad, to see the world and seek my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the great surprise of the men, and, perhaps, of Watt
himself, Evans seemed cowed by his threats, and, after a little
show of parleying, gave him that freedom of which he had no right
to deprive him.&nbsp; Leaving him alone in his cottage, he
shuffled home, accompanied by his worthless followers.</p>
<p>While Watt&rsquo;s cottage became the theatre of the
above-described scene, Twm Shon Catty had a performance of his
own elsewhere&mdash;a dance if you will&mdash;to which the same
reverend gentleman was doomed to pay the piper.&nbsp; Having
watched the party to Watt&rsquo;s door, Twm hastened to the
parson&rsquo;s, calling loudly in the assumed voice of one of the
fellows who accompanied, &ldquo;Mistress Evans!&nbsp; Mistress
Evans! make haste and send master his pocket-book with his money,
immediately; Twm Shon Catty is taken, and we are going off with
him to Cardigan gaol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Evans sleeping in a front room, heard him <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>instantly,
and with unusual alacrity jumped off bed; she soon threw down the
pocket-book, which was caught by Twm, and asked him,
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he want his weather-proof great coat
also?&rdquo;&nbsp; Our hero replied, &ldquo;Yes, but, dear me, I
did forget that,&rdquo; and immediately received the great coat
likewise.&nbsp; Mrs. Evans wishing them safe home from Cardigan,
shut the window.&nbsp; The saddled horse was already at the gate,
and Twm, well coated and cashed, instantly mounted and rode off,
glorying in his triumph over his old rancorous enemy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; thought Twm, &ldquo;is tangible revenge for
all the trouble and persecution this reverend gentleman has
brought upon me.&rdquo;&nbsp; A full pocket-book, a good horse,
and a warm great coat, after all, were not bad equivalents for
Twm&rsquo;s injuries.&nbsp; Some philosophers might consider that
outraged feelings could not be solaced in this way.&nbsp; But in
Twm&rsquo;s case, at any rate, they were mistaken.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> is robbed by a
highwayman.&nbsp; His meditations.&nbsp; Again is despoiled by a
gipsy and a ballad-singer at Aberayon.&nbsp; He adopts the
musical profession at Cardigan Fair.</p>
<p>Twm took a circuitous route over the mountains towards
Lampeter, and, when he felt himself secure from pursuit, his
first thought was to change his feminine attire for his own, as
more convenient for riding, which was soon accomplished, and the
suits changed places in the bundle.&nbsp; In his ignorance of the
world, he scarce knew whither to direct his course after reaching
Lampeter, where he arrived between one and two o&rsquo;clock in
the morning.&nbsp; He recollected that this was a central place,
from which different roads led to Aberystwith, Llandovery,
Carmarthen, Aberayon, and Cardigan; but found a difficulty in
deciding which way to take.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>It
suddenly occurred to him that there was a fair at Cardigan the
next day, and he determined to go there and sell the
parson&rsquo;s horse.&nbsp; The whole town being wrapped in
slumbers, he was now at a stand, not knowing the road which led
through Aberayon to Cardigan; but, rousing a cottager, he soon
gained the necessary information, and proceeded on.</p>
<p>As he approached Aberayon, for the first time in his life, the
distant roaring of the sea struck upon his ear, still increasing
as he neared the ocean side.&nbsp; Wonder, awe, and even terror,
were the successive sensations that agitated our hero.&nbsp; The
saddening sobs of the mighty waters as they retreated from the
shore, and the fearful fury of their rallying and re-assaulting
the repulsing beach, with their successive wailing retreats, to
gather the powers of the advancing tide, came on his soul like an
accusing spirit that seemed to reproach him for his late
misdeeds.</p>
<p>Severe self-accusing reflection on the atrocity of his last
act, succeeded the triumphs of enmity that had first given a gust
to its perpetration.&nbsp; Consciousness of guilt and terror of
punishment at once assailed him, for he was yet young in
crime.&nbsp; On the impulse of the moment, he determined to leave
the parson&rsquo;s nag behind him, and then return his cash and
coat as early as possible.</p>
<p>While these bitter agitations were racking his breast, the
clatter of a galloping horse increased his terrors, and he
discerned both horse and rider making briskly towards him.&nbsp;
Strange as it may appear, notwithstanding the opposite quarter
from where the danger proceeded, in the wildness of his
apprehensions he conceived it could be no other than Squire
Graspacre, Parson Evans, and their party.&nbsp; He was actually
glad when made to understand that the horseman was a
highwayman.&nbsp; His unwelcome assailant quickly approached him
and presenting his pistol, with a loud oath, to oblige &ldquo;Dio
the Devil&rdquo; with all his cash and valuables, or prepare for
immediate death.</p>
<p>The name of this terrific freebooter, who had, <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>among many
other descriptions of persons, robbed half the farmers in the
country, and was supposed to have committed more than one murder,
had its full effect upon Twm.&nbsp; He instantly resigned the
parson&rsquo;s purse, assuring him it was all he possessed and
begged that he would allow him to retain a single angel; these
terms, the robber, in a manner, acceded to, doubling his quest by
giving two; but in return insisted on having his horse and great
coat, which Twm gave up.&nbsp; Dio (whose name, by the way, is a
familiar diminutive of David,) then with sarcastic politeness
wished him good morning, and a pleasant journey! and galloped off
in the direction of Lampeter, having the rein of the
parson&rsquo;s horse over his left arm.</p>
<p>No sooner had the highwaymen disappeared, than Twm was struck
with a full conviction of the folly of the fears he had
entertained, which by depressing his mind, he thought, led to
confusedly yielding his property too easily: vowing to himself,
after some reflection, that if possessed of a pair of pistols, no
highwayman in the world should make him stand.&nbsp; His thoughts
taking their course through this channel, wandered and diverged,
till his mind rested on new, but perilous prospects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a life,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;this Dio the
Devil leads&mdash;a gentleman of the road&mdash;the terror of
wealthy scoundrels, who are themselves the scourge of the hapless
poor, that are starved into crime&mdash;famed, feared, and mained
at the general cost, while many an honest fool toils like the
gulled drudge-horse, crawls through the world half-starved, and
is despised for meanness!&rdquo;&nbsp; The weight and magnitude
of his reflections were such as for a few moments to reduce him
to absolute silence, when recovering himself, he continued,
&ldquo;What does it matter to me what others do?&nbsp; I shall
please myself, and I don&rsquo;t like hard work, nor do I care
for coarse fare, and still less for great folk&rsquo;s abuse and
buffets; and if I had a pistol, why, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind
if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment a countryman was about to pass <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>him on the
road, in whose hand he recognized his bundle, containing his
feminine attire, which in his terror he had dropped, and it
rolled from the side of the road, it seems, into the ditch,
previous to the halt of the highwayman.&nbsp; Twm immediately
claimed his property, but the fellow seemed disinclined to attend
to him, until vehemently insisting on his right, he evinced an
inclination to battle with him; when satisfied with this very
convincing sort of logic, the clown made restitution.</p>
<p>His little affray with the would-be-dishonest countryman, had
not obliterated the thought of our hero with respect to
highwaymen, and their independent style of existence, and with
his mind still occupied, with the gentlemen of the road, he came
to a small public-house near Aberayon, but which was so
inconveniently crowded that he could scarce find a seat.</p>
<p>With the exception of two or three fishermen and other
seafarers, these were people who made a temporary halt on their
way to Cardigan fair; low booth-keepers, fruit and gingerbread
sellers, and suchlike.&nbsp; Twm called for beer and refreshment,
and while eating, observed the habits of these strange people
with much curiosity.&nbsp; He had contrived to squeeze himself
into a window-seat between two females who sat apart and civilly
made room for him, and pressed his acceptance of the place.</p>
<p>Twm was delighted with his new position, and he was not a
little surprised with the contrast which the kindness and
affability of his fair companions offered to the rude gestures
and uncouth speech of the remainder of the party.&nbsp; He did
not think worse of them when he discovered that one was a gipsy
fortune-teller, and the other a ballad-singer.&nbsp; He could not
do less, he thought, than ask them to partake of his cup, and
they found themselves bound in honour, in their great devotion to
his health, to return it empty each time he handed it to them
full.</p>
<p>Such gallantry on the one hand, and confidence and affability
on the other, begot a sudden friendship <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>between
them; the gipsy insisting upon telling his fortune gratis, and
the ballad-singer on the acceptance of two or three favourite
songs; while Twm reciprocating in the warmest style, their
affectionate attentions, ordered indefinite supplies of
&ldquo;nut-brown,&rdquo; on which he and his fair ones regaled to
their hearts&rsquo; content.</p>
<p>While Twm was busily employed in looking over the bundle of
ballads, among which he met many old friends, which he had
frequently sung, one of the friendly nymphs was beckoned to, by a
man at the opposite end of the kitchen, with whom they went out,
and the gipsy soon followed them.</p>
<p>Our hero having selected the songs that pleased him, waited
impatiently the return of the damsels.&nbsp; No sign of their
re-appearance being visible, and all the fair people having left
one by one, until Twm found himself quite alone, he inquired of
the landlord if he knew where the young women had gone to.&nbsp;
He said he did not, but that the whole party having paid him were
gone off, and he had no further business with them.</p>
<p>Twm thought the ballad-singer a singular good-natured young
woman, as she had left her bundles of melody with him, doubtless
as a present, and merely taken herself away thus modestly,
instead of ostentatiously proclaiming her gift, and receiving his
thanks.&nbsp; His opinion was slightly changed, when wishful to
pay the landlord, he found he had not a halfpenny in his
pocket.&nbsp; His vexation and confusion were evident to mine
host, who declared that his face was turned as white as the
wall.&nbsp; Having searched every pocket over and over, at length
the doleful tale came out that he had lost his money, and could
not tell how.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as to that,&rdquo; said the landlord, with bitter
coolness, &ldquo;if it is any satisfaction to know <i>how</i> you
lost your money, I can tell you; it was by sitting between two
thieves&mdash;a gipsy and a ballad-singer and what could you
expect else from mixing with <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>such cattle?&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Twm
remained silent, in a miserable mood, with his elbows resting on
the table, and with his temples in the palms of his hands, for a
full half hour; when the landlord disturbed his meditations by
asking payment for his fare; good-naturedly adding, &ldquo;If you
have no money, I don&rsquo;t wish to be hard with you, you can
merely leave your jacket with me instead.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My
jacket!&rdquo; quoth he indignantly; &ldquo;why that is ten times
the value of what I owe you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
just as people think; but those are my terms, and you should be
glad that I&rsquo;ll take it in place of good hard cash,&rdquo;
was the reply of the uncompromising old fellow.&nbsp; The
fishermen in the mean time passed on him their rough and scurvy
jokes, one observing, &ldquo;You can sing ballads without a
jacket, so I advise you to go to the fair at Cardigan, where you
may perhaps meet your old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm was too despondent to be much effected by these feeble
attempts at wit, but he determined to accept the suggestion of
the last speaker, and make his first appearance as a public
vocalist in Cardigan, so without more ado he took off his jacket
and gave it to the host, muttering a curse on his cruelty, and
commenced his journey.&nbsp; The dress of Cadwgan&rsquo;s wife
was again put on, not only as a fit disguise for his minstrel
vocation, but a more perfect guard against the weather than his
own, since deprived of his upper-garment; and thus equipped he
once more took to the road, his late experience having completely
sobered him, and left him depressed in spirits, as he glanced at
the scene in which he had been thoroughly victimized.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm&rsquo;s</span>
appearance as a &ldquo;fair&rdquo; ballad singer at
Cardigan.&nbsp; A sudden alarm.&nbsp; Poor Parson Inco.&nbsp;
Twm&rsquo;s hasty flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The longest lane has a turning,&rdquo; and the weariest
journey has an end, and at length Twm found himself in Cardigan,
and prepared himself at once to commence his whimsical
vocation.&nbsp; Although naturally bold, and more full of
confidence than beseemed the modesty of youth, it was not without
considerable efforts in struggling with some remains of
diffidence that he at length ventured to sing in the public
street; but he had fortified himself with a draught of strong
beer, and his voice, in his own opinion, being almost unequalled
in the country, he thought it foolish to hesitate.&nbsp; He fixed
himself in rather an obscure part of the fair; but his musical
voice and humorous execution of a comic song soon drew a crowd
about him, and put his ballads in speedy request.</p>
<p>Adapting the usual gait and manner of street-vocalists,
holding his hand to his mouth to secure increased power, he
introduced each song with a whimsical description of its matter,
in a strain of drollery that set the grinning rustics in high
glee; &ldquo;Here, my merry men and maidens,&rdquo; quoth he,
&ldquo;is a pretty song about a young damsel, who was taken in by
a false lover, that courted her for what he could get, and having
wheedled her out of her heart and money, ran away and left her to
wear the willow.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE SLIGHTED

&nbsp;&nbsp; Full many and many a night,<br />
I thought he came to woo me&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart was all delight:<br />
My cash he thought of gaining,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not me he sought,<br />
E&rsquo;er mourning and complaining<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For clothes&mdash;and clothes I bought.</p>
<p>A pair of shoes I placed him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Between his soles and ground,<br />
With stockings then I graced him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With hat his head I crown&rsquo;d;<br />
Red garters then I bought him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At fair the best I saw,<br />
To bind his hose, od rod him!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of bands of straw.</p>
<p>I bought him leather breeches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strong as a barley sack,<br />
And laid out half my riches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To clothe the beggar&rsquo;s back;<br />
I gave him money willing,<br />

His hair, like garden carrot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full soon will want a hat;<br />
How soon, indeed I care not,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The devil care for that!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>His
listeners appreciated his first song so much that all his copies
were soon disposed of; so he selected another, before singing
which he said: &ldquo;Now this, my friends, is about a Welsh boy,
who was so foolish as to leave old Cymry and go to London, from
which place, I warrant you, he would have been glad enough to
return, as they have neither leeks, cheese, nor flummery, nor
anything else there fit for a Christian people.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">When</span> a wild rural Welsh
boy I ran o&rsquo;er the hills,<br />
And sprang o&rsquo;er the hedges, the gates, brooks, and
rills,<br />
The high oak I climb&rsquo;d for the nest of the kite,<br />
And plung&rsquo;d in the river with ardent delight!<br />
Ah, who then so cheerful, so happy as me,<br />
As I skipp&rsquo;d through the woodlands and meads of
Brandee?</p>
<p>How oft have I wander&rsquo;d through swamp, hedge, or
brake,<br />
While fearful of nought but the never-seen snake,<br />
And gather&rsquo;d brown nuts from the copses around,<br />
While ev&rsquo;ry bush echoed with harmony&rsquo;s sound!<br />
Oh, gladness then thrill&rsquo;d me!&nbsp; I bounded as free<br
/>
As a hart o&rsquo;er the lawn through the meads of Brandee.</p>
<p>Whenever I wander&rsquo;d to some neighb&rsquo;ring farm,<br
/>
How kindly was tendered the new milk so warm,<br />
O&rsquo;er her best loaf as butter-or-honey she&rsquo;d
spread,<br />
The farm wife so friendly would stroke my white head,<br />
And sure that she shortly again would see me<br />
Whenever my rambles led forth from Brandee.</p>
<p>How oft have I run with my strawberry wreath<br />
To rosy young Gwenny of fair Llwyn-y-neath,<br />
And help&rsquo;d her to drive the white sheep to the pen!<br />
Oh! still I think how joyously sung little Gwen!<br />
The old folks, oft chuckling, vow&rsquo;d sweet-hearts were
we,<br />
Then Llwyn-y-neath maiden and boy of Brandee.</p>
<p>At the fair of Devynnock, o&rsquo;ertaken by night,<br />
Returning, I&rsquo;ve dreaded the corpse-candle light,<br />
The wandering spirit, the hobgoblin fell,<br />
Of which cottage hen-wives so fearfully tell:<br />
I&rsquo;ve ran, with my eyes shut, ghosts dreading to see,<br />
Prayed, whistled, or sang as I flew to Brandee.</p>
<p>Pleasure and innocence hand in hand went,<br />
My deeds ever blameless, my heart e&rsquo;er content,<br />
<a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>Unknown
to ambition, and free from all care,<br />
A stranger to sorrow, remorse, or despair;<br />
Oh bless&rsquo;d were those days! long departed from me,<br />
Far, far&rsquo;s my loved Cambria! far, far is Brandee!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This did not take so well as the first, but Twm, now
thoroughly interested in his new vocation, commenced a fresh
ditty, which he announced as a sequel to the last.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">ROSY GWEN.</p>
<p>Rosy Gwen, Rosy Gwen,<br />
Beloved of maids, beloved of men:<br />
Aye, dearly loved of grave and gay,<br />
In youth&rsquo;s early day&mdash;ah, what cheer&rsquo;d me
then?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas her voice so sweet,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her person neat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her form so sleek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her spirit meek,<br />
And the cherry-merry cheek of Rosy Gwen.</p>
<p>Gentle girl, gentle girl,<br />
Coral lipp&rsquo;d, with teeth of pearl,<br />
On either cheek a vivid rose,<br />
And raven tresses graced thy brows!<br />
Ah, thou wert my love and playmate then!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy lass of smiles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unvers&rsquo;d in wiles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of guileless breast&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of minds the best.<br />
Oh my merry-cheek&rsquo;d young Rosy Gwen!</p>
<p>Years have flown, years have flown,<br />
And Gwenny thour&rsquo;t a woman grown,<br />
While Time, that bears for most a sting,<br />
Has fann&rsquo;d thy beauties with his wing;<br />
Yet brighter thou canst not be than when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the mountain steep<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou drov&rsquo;st thy sheep,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sang in glee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A child with me,<br />
Oh my cheery-merry-cheek&rsquo;d young Rosy Gwen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the last was but tolerated, the singer soon found that a
merry strain was most congenial to their fancies.&nbsp; He
therefore gave them the old and popular duet of <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>&ldquo;Hob
y deri dando,&rdquo; rendered more comical by his singing
alternately shrill and gruff, for male and female&rsquo;s
parts.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">HOB Y DERI DANDO. <a

</blockquote>
<p>He sang the last three tunes, and sold a dozen copies; but
just as he was going to favour his audience with <i>Nos
Galan</i>, the malignant face of Parson Evans presented itself
before him.</p>
<p>As our hero wore petticoats, many gallant swains offered their
treats of cake and ale, some of which was accepted; and presuming
on that circumstance, they amusingly put in their claims to
further notice, and seemed inclined to quarrel, as for a
sweetheart.</p>
<p>With this phalanx of protectors, beaus, and chaperons, Twm
resolved to employ them in a new scheme of vengeance on the
unpopular parson.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>that old
fellow in black,&rdquo; said he, directing their attention to him
as he passed, &ldquo;he is a bumbailiff, and the greatest villain
in all the country I come from; and at this very moment,
I&rsquo;ll be bound for it, he is hunting out some poor fellow to
put him in prison.&nbsp; He wanted to be a lover of mine, but
only intended to ruinate me; but if he had loved me ever so much
I would not have had him, if his old yellow skin was stuffed with
diamonds.&nbsp; The villainous old catchpole! it was owing to
refusing him for a sweetheart, that he grew as spiteful as a
snake, and by telling a parcel of falsehoods he got me turned out
of my place without a character, so that I am now brought to
this&mdash;to sing ballads in the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, assuming a whimpering tone, Twm was compelled to smother
a fit of laughter, which emotion was taken for sobbing, and
consequently drew much on the sympathy of those now addressed!
but suddenly withdrawing the apron that veiled the features, he
exclaimed, with the vehemence of a young termagant,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give the world to see that old fellow tossed in
a blanket!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark Antony&rsquo;s effort of eloquence
to rouse the Roman citizens to avenge the death of C&aelig;sar,
was not more effective than our hero&rsquo;s appeal.</p>
<p>Every one of those swains manifested the usual predilection
for the smiles of a handsome young woman; being &ldquo;full of
distempering draughts&rdquo; and ripe for a freak, their zeal
became inflamed to a ferment; each felt himself the leading hero
to avenge the wrongs of the fair ballad singer, in the manner
suggested by himself.</p>
<p>One of the young men, a native of the town, and son to the
innkeeper, immediately procured a blanket, when, watching their
opportunity as the supposed bailiff passed along, one tripped up
his heels, while the rest received him in the extended blanket,
and proceeded to the work-like play of giving the Black Kite an
airing; or as Ready Rosser, a cunning clod of the party,
expressed it, playing the wind-instrument to the tune of the
Bumbailiff&rsquo;s courante.&nbsp; The athletic <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>employments
of grasping the plough-handles, as they guided it through a
stubborn soil, and the no less powerful exertions of wielding the
axe, or hedge-bill, had their due effect in nerving the brawny
arms of those youths of the farm and woodlands for this rough
exercise.</p>
<p>Drawing the extended blanket as tight as a drumhead, with
their united efforts, up they tossed, re-tossed, and received
into what threatened to be his winding-sheet, the quivering and
terribly-frightened body of the Rev. and very worshipful Inco
Evans.&nbsp; Whatever it might be to the parson, (and we do not
venture to assert that it was agreeable to him,) the spectator of
this singular and unexpected entertainment could not but enjoy it
for the comical revolutions of the right rev. gentleman were, to
say the least of them, very mirth-inspiring.&nbsp; As he flew
upward, all legs and wings, and descended in the same sprawling
style, one compared him to a cat shot from a cannon; another to a
staked toad tossed in the air; while the hapless victim of their
frolic foamed at the mouth with rage, and uncouthly floundered in
his attempt to grasp the blanket in his fall.&nbsp; If for a
moment he seized its edge, and shouted his threats of vengeance,
a terrific bump against the stony street loosened his hold, and
up he bounced, again like the rebounding ball, struck on the
flag-stone by the eager hand of a merry schoolboy.</p>
<p>Wearied by their arduous labours, and tempted by the shining
handful of silver which the woe-begone parson eagerly offered as
a conciliatory bribe, they at length desisted, each venting his
jest on the crest-fallen Evans, &ldquo;hoping it would be a
warning not to prosecute again a poor friendless
girl.&rdquo;&nbsp; Inco answered not; but finding himself unable
to walk, he was carried to the Inn, where he remained some days
before he was able to remount his horse.</p>
<p>The knot of swains now separated, and ran in different
directions to avoid being recognized as the perpetrators of the
&ldquo;freak;&rdquo; but soon met again at <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>an
appointed place, where they had left our hero, between the empty
carts of the ware vendors.</p>
<p>On their arrival at the place, they searched in vain for their
enchantress, in whose service they had wrought so gallantly, but
no traces of the fair one could they find.&nbsp; There was a
general smelling of a trick put upon them, and consequent
&ldquo;curses on all jilting jades, and biting
ballad-singers,&rdquo; uttered by the unlucky clods.</p>
<p>A brilliant idea suddenly struck Ready Rosser.&nbsp; He had
taken off his coat and left it in the careful custody of the
injured damsel.&nbsp; Where was she?&nbsp; Could she have
disappeared?&nbsp; All doubts were soon removed, for on
ascertaining the precise spot where he had left her, he found her
complete feminine attire, made into a bundle and fastened to a
cart with a band of straw, left as a love-gift for him, while she
kept his as a similar token of affection; having inscribed with
chalk on the side of the cart.&mdash;&ldquo;An exchange is no
robbery;&rdquo; a motto in which our rustic could not see, in its
present application, any principles of justice whatever.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Escape</span> of Twm from
Cardigan.&nbsp; Meets an old friend.&nbsp; The heiress of
Maes-y-velin, a most tragical legendary ballad.</p>
<p>The addition to his wardrobe pleased Twm exactly, and he had
no qualms of conscience to prevent him from using it, for he
remembered how easily he had been despoiled of his own.&nbsp; Not
being fastidious about a dressing-room, Twm retired to a stable,
and soon came out fully clad in his male attire; of which a coat
only was before wanting.</p>
<p>Bent on a precipitate retreat, as the urgency of his case
demanded, he bolted down St. Mary&rsquo;s Street, and soon found
himself on the turnpike road, with <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>the good town of Cardigan some miles
behind him.&nbsp; In little more than two hours he reached the
small town of Dinas Emlyn, now called New-castle-in-Emlyn, on a
romantic part of the Teivy, dividing the counties of Cardigan and
Carmarthen, and occupying its banks on each side.&nbsp; Entering
a small public-house, he regaled himself on the fine potent ale
for which that place has been so long famous.</p>
<p>After addressing himself steadily for a good half hour to the
pleasures of the table, he commenced a little private
conversation with himself regarding his present and future
prospects, and came to the conclusion that, on the whole, they
were not worth much.&nbsp; Although the most serious cogitations
on the subject might have availed little or nothing, chance very
unexpectedly decided him, and relieved his apprehensions for the
present.</p>
<p>He could hear, in the adjoining room, a pig-drover, whose
potations had not only loosened his tongue, but invested it with
unusual power, boasting of his roaring trade at Cardigan fair,
and he determined to take the same route, wherever it might lead,
and on inquiry, found he was going to Llandovery.</p>
<p>The inebriated dealer in cattle, glad of company, stretched
out his hand at once and welcomed him as a fellow
traveller.&nbsp; About ten o&rsquo;clock that night they arrived
together at Lampeter, which Twm now visited for the second
time.&nbsp; The geography of the country being but little known
to him, he felt some alarm on finding himself so contiguous to
his own native place.</p>
<p>Twm and the pig-drover were getting thoroughly jolly and
comfortable over a pot of foaming ale, when Twm caught sight of
an old friend.&nbsp; It was worthy Rhys the curate, who had spied
him from the little parlour where he had been sitting before his
arrival, and now cordially welcomed him to partake of his supper,
which was then preparing.</p>
<p>Shaking hands with the elated pig-jobber, from whom he had
heard all the mysteries of his calling, and bidding him good
night and wishing him success <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>in his future dealings, Twm joyously
accepted the curate&rsquo;s invitation to partake of his evening
repast.&nbsp; Supper dispatched, Mr. Rhys informed him that he
had left Tregaron for ever, disgusted with the treatment he had
met with from old Evans, and was on his way to Llandovery to take
possession of the curacy of Llandingad, to which he had been just
appointed by the vicar, the reverend Rhys Prichard.</p>
<p>In return, Twm recited his late adventures, colouring them in
such a manner as to create a favourable impression on the curate,
who laughed heartily at many points of his story, and finished by
saying that he had also determined to visit Llandovery in quest
of his fortune, which, somehow or another, he thought he should
find there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your fortunes are
altogether romantic, and fortitude such as yours is a virtue that
becomes us all.&nbsp; Whatever I can do to get you into
employment, when you are there, rest assured shall not be
wanting.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this understanding Twm&rsquo;s hopes
were buoyed up to the highest pitch, and to his sanguine mind,
became already certainties, which presented themselves in dreams
of various felicitous shapes.</p>
<p>They were both early astir the following morning, and were
soon on the road, the curate leading his horse by the bridle,
that (generous and considerate soul) he might be on a level with
Twm.&nbsp; They had nearly reached the top of Pen-y-garreg hill,
over which the road leads from Lampeter to Llandovery, while a
bright prospect of the newly-risen sun attracted their mutual
attention, when the clergyman thus addressed his companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now on the spot to be yet immortalized, perhaps,
by the legendary muse, for a deed of blood perpetrated here in
our own times; when the banks of the impetuous Teivy, now before
us, became the scene of a lamentable tragedy.&nbsp; The towers in
the distance, are all that now remain of the family mansion of
<span class="smcap">Maes-y-velin</span>, the fair seat of the
ancient family of the <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Vaughans, once of considerable note
in this part of the principality.&nbsp; Ten years ago, a young
lady and her three brothers, the last of that race, were its
possessors.&nbsp; The lady named Ellen, was exceedingly
beautiful, and beloved by the son of the venerable Rhys Prichard,
the present vicar of Llandovery, whose curate I am now
become.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the very place where we now stand, the young man
tied his handkerchief to the end of a rod, that he held as a
flag-staff, which was immediately seen by the heiress of
Maes-y-velin; and when she could succeed in getting her brothers
out of the way, the signal of love was answered by hoisting her
own handkerchief to a branch of a tree above the house, on which,
both ran down from their respective hills, till they stood face
to face on either side of the Teivy, when the fond lover,
whenever the stream was unfordable, dashed into the river,
crossed over, and caught the fair one in his arms.&nbsp; Perhaps
you would like to hear the tragical story at further length; if
so, I have employed my leisure time lately in versifying it, and
will now read it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm signifying his willing assent, they took their seats on
the side of the hill, when Rhys drew a manuscript from his pocket
and read to his attentive auditor</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE HEIRESS OF
MAES-Y-VELIN<br />
<span class="smcap">and</span><br />
<span class="smcap">The Flower of Llandovery</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span> is amiss with the maiden
fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the sweet one ailing?&mdash;<br />
Why pale her cheek, and her spirits low<br />
And why up the hill doth she daily go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heiress of Maes-y-velin?</p>
<p>Why are the brows of her brothers dark?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor mother nor sire hath Ellen;&mdash;<br />
Her brothers whisper&mdash;her steps they watch&mdash;<br />
The heart of her mystery eager to catch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The maiden of Maes-y-velin.</p>
<p>The parents of Ellen her merits knew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And frown&rsquo;d on her brothers&rsquo; vices:<br
/>
<a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Her
brothers are disinherited,<br />
And Ellen is heiress in either&rsquo;s stead;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereat all the land rejoices.</p>
<p>Her brothers one day went out to hunt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And alone at home left Ellen;<br />
She watch&rsquo;d them away, then flew to her bower,<br />
And cried &ldquo;Oh now for Llandovery&rsquo;s Flower!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Right welcome to Maes-y-velin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hoisted her silken kerchief red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the highest branch of her bower,<br />
To Pen-garreg hill then strained her eyes,<br />
And the flag of her hope was seen to rise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas thine, oh Llandovery&rsquo;s Flower!</p>
<p>Long had he watch&rsquo;d&mdash;the faithful youth!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His wish each day unavailing.<br />
At length he sees with wild delight,<br />
His true love&rsquo;s signal, the lady bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heiress of Maes-y-velin.</p>
<p>The signal that was chosen between the twain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When absent her stern proud kindred;<br />
And then would they rush from either hill,<br />
The lovers true, with a right good-will,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the waters of Teivy sunder&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Now as ers&rsquo;t they rush&rsquo;d, and as ers&rsquo;t they
paused,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When arrived on the banks of Teivy,<br />
They gazed at each other across the stream,<br />
And gestured affection&rsquo;s high glow supreme,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the two hearts grew less heavy.</p>
<p>In plung&rsquo;d the youth with most anxious speed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The flower of fair Llandovery,<br />
The maiden trembling with wild alarms&mdash;<br />
She brightens&mdash;she sinks in her true lover&rsquo;s arms,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deem&rsquo;d lost her past recovery.</p>
<p>Oh nature hath many warm generous glows&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they say love&rsquo;s joys are fleeting;<br />
Most dear to her mother her new-born son,<br />
And sweet is the fame that&rsquo;s fairly won,<br />
To the blind restor&rsquo;d, oh the summer&rsquo;s sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Less sweet than the lovers meeting!</p>
<p>Sweet to the donor the generous deed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That serves merit&rsquo;s child, unweeting;<br />
<a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>Healing
is sweet when gashed by the sword;<br />
To the wounded heart, the benevolent word:<br />
Oh sweet is the breeze to the sick restored;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But sweeter true lover&rsquo;s greeting.</p>
<p>Each flower that flaunts in vanity&rsquo;s cap,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sets youthful hearts a gadding,<br />
Has its charms, its zest,&mdash;but the whole above,<br />
Is the magical thrill of sweet woman&rsquo;s love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That drives heart and brain a madding.</p>
<p>And fondly loved this youthful pair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heiress of Maes-y-velin,<br />
And he to whom they called Llandovery&rsquo;s Flower;<br />
Oh frequent their meeting and parting hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their moments of joy and wailing.</p>
<p>Once when they met on Teivy&rsquo;s banks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Canopied o&rsquo;er by the wild wood,<br />
Mid fragrance of flowers that graced the shade,<br />
The youth sung his song, of true lovers betrayed,<br />
An ominous song&mdash;that drew tears from the maid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For her heart was as simple as childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh come to the banks of the Teivy with me,<br />
To the deep woodland glade, &rsquo;neath the shady green tree,<br
/>
Fearless of foemen, of guile, or of might,<br />
In the face of the day and the bright eye of light,<br />
That God and his angels may witness our troth,<br />
That God and his angels may favour us both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go the green-wood,&rsquo; the lady
replied,<br />
&lsquo;Fore God and his angels be fairly affied,<br />
Fearless of foemen, of guile, or of might,<br />
In the face of the day and the bright eye of light;<br />
That God and his angels may witness our troth,<br />
That God and his angels may favour us both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So sung a young chief to his lady love,<br />
At the base of her tower&mdash;she answered above&mdash;<br />
Vile vassals espied them, and flew to their lord,<br />
The lady&rsquo;s true lover soon fell &rsquo;neath his sword;<br
/>
She hurled herself headlong, fulfilling her troth,<br />
And Death was the priest that united them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PART II.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> the hill of Pen-garreg road<br

The mansion below&mdash;oft on either height,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lovers are making discovery.&mdash;</p>
<p>But envious eyes were on the watch,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the genius of evil hover&rsquo;d;<br />
The brothers who wish&rsquo;d their sister unmatch&rsquo;d,<br />
For any approach of a lover watch&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At length their flags discover&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>They hatch&rsquo;d a scheme to enmesh the youth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And see him at length on the mountain;<br />
His flag they answer&mdash;he runs down the hill&mdash;<br />
Now forth rush the wretches resolved to kill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And waste his youth heart&rsquo;s warm fountain.</p>
<p>Like prey-beasts they hide on the Teivy&rsquo;s banks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the covert of thick-leaved bushes;<br />
The youth he dashes across the river,<br />
And ardent to seek his fond receiver,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He seeks her form in the rushes&mdash;</p>
<p>He deems she plays him at hide and seek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart he knew was gayful&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Oh come from thy covert, my Ellen dear?<br />
Oh come forth and meet thy lover here!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He cries in soft accents playful.</p>
<p>No Ellen appears&mdash;rustling steps he hears&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps some perfidious stranger;&mdash;<br />
He quits the rushes, and steals to a copse,<br />
But there not an instant for breathing stops,<br />
Peril&rsquo;s presentiment suddenly drops,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he flies for his life from danger.</p>
<p>He knew not his foes, up the hill he goes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the speed of the hart that&rsquo;s hunted:<br
/>
The brothers pursue, till fatigued they grew<br />
To Maes-y-velin his course they knew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And eager revenge is blunted&mdash;</p>
<p>They saw him enter&mdash;&ldquo;the foe is snared!&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Exclaimed the elder brother;<br />
&ldquo;To kill him surely be firmly prepared,<br />
Accursed be the arm by which he is spared!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s stab him, or drown, or
smother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do him dead, and no matter how,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And our sister&rsquo;s fortune is ours;<br />
<a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>No brats
of her&rsquo;s shall supplant our hope:<br />
Prepare we a dagger, a sack, and rope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For brief are the stripling&rsquo;s
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now rush&rsquo;d the youth through the mansion door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fell at the feet of Ellen;<br />
Ere he could speak the brothers appear,<br />
The maiden shrieks with terrific fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heiress of Maes-y-velin.</p>
<p>She fell in a swoon, the brothers soon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gag and proceed to bind him,<br />
His hands they fasten&rsquo;d behind his back,<br />
And over his head they drew a sack,<br />
They jump on his body&mdash;his rib bones crack,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till a corpse on the ground they find him.</p>
<p>Oh God! &rsquo;twas a barbarous, bloody deed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas piteous to hear him groaning;<br />
A demon&rsquo;s heart might relent to hear<br />
The sobs of death, and convulsions drear&mdash;<br />
Oh Christ! is no merciful angel near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Call&rsquo;d down by this woeful moaning!&mdash;</p>
<p>Oh murderous fiends! the eye of God<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath flamed on this tearless murder!<br />
They grasp at his throat to check his breath&mdash;<br />
With knees on his breast&mdash;oh merciful death!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou sav&rsquo;st him from anguish further.</p>
<p>And dead in the sack his body they bore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sunk in a pool of the Teivy;<br />
After many days when the corpse was found,<br />
No tongue could tell whether smother&rsquo;d or drown&rsquo;d,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or crush&rsquo;d by men&rsquo;s buffets heavy.</p>
<p>Thus fell in its bloom the blameless youth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Insanity seized on Ellen,<br />
The lovely maniac! with bosom bare,<br />
And eyes of wildness, and streaming hair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Roved frantic o&rsquo;er Maes-y-velin.</p>
<p>She said he was thrown in the Teivy&rsquo;s stream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The flower of fair Llandovery;<br />
She cross&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the hills to his father&rsquo;s
town,<br />
And he bless&rsquo;d the maid like a child of his own;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Ellen was past recovery.</p>
<p>Rhys Prichard wept long o&rsquo;er his murder&rsquo;d son<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And buried the hapless Ellen;<br />
<a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>He
curs&rsquo;d her brothers&mdash;the land of their birth&mdash;<br
/>
He curs&rsquo;d their mansion, its hall and hearth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the curse is on Maes-y-velin.</p>
<p>Strong was the curse on the savage race,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The murderers and their kindred;<br />
Their bosoms possess&rsquo;d by the furies of hell,<br />
Oft vented the scream, the curse, and the yell;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All men stood aloof and wonder&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>They quarrell&rsquo;d and stood forth in mortal strife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each one oppos&rsquo;d to the other:<br />
They never, oh never! are doom&rsquo;d to agree,<br />
While sharing poor Ellen&rsquo;s property,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To murder their elder brother.</p>
<p>And yet the murderers still are foes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Furious and unrelenting;<br />
Each coveting all his sister&rsquo;s share;<br />
At length one falls in the other&rsquo;s snare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere yet of his crimes repenting.</p>
<p>Now lived the survivor, a man forbid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For murder his brow had branded&mdash;<br />
Shunn&rsquo;d by all men, none bade him God speed,<br />
But solitude work&rsquo;d wild remorse for his deed,<br />
In madness he seiz&rsquo;d on a poisonous weed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in a suicide&rsquo;s grave he landed.</p>
<p>Maes-y-velin became a deserted spot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The roof of the mansion tumbled;<br />
The lawns and the gardens o&rsquo;er-ran with weeds,<br />
And reptiles, vile emblems of hellish deeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bred there, and the strong walls
crumbled.&mdash;</p>
<p>They crumbled to dust, and fell to the earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And strangers bought Maes-y-velin;<br />
Vain, it is said, their attempts to rebuild,<br />
Vain was their labour in garden or field.<br />
Snakes, toads, baneful weeds alone they yield.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not a stone to another adhering.</p>
<p>The possessors fled, and oft others came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But all their aims unavailing;<br />
The peasants protest that at midnight hour,<br />
The spirit of Ellen is seen in her bower.<br />
While on Pen-gorreg stands Llandovery&rsquo;s Flower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shrieks burst from Maes-y-velin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Twm
had listened with the most earnest attention to the terrible
account, and rivetted his eyes on Maes-y-velin, the two hills,
the banks of the Teivy, and scenes now subordinate to the modern
grandeur of the new college of Lampeter; and still remaining
silent, seemed, by the force of his imagination, to bring before
his eyes the whole action of this domestic tragedy.&nbsp; Rhys
assured him that all the particulars of the murder, as narrated
in the ballad, were well authenticated, both by the evidence of
the unhappy young lady herself, and that of a countryman who
beheld the murderers bearing the body by night, and who
distinctly saw, as the moon shone upon them while in the act of
casting their burden into the river, the shining spurs of the
murdered youth, projecting from the end of the sack which
contained his body.&nbsp; But in so disorderly a state was the
country at the time, from the civil wars between the king and the
parliament, that no cognizance was taken of the atrocious
circumstance. <a name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a>&nbsp; After these remarks, they got up
from their grassy resting-place, and re-commenced their walk to
Llandovery.</p>
<h2><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A <span class="smcap">sermon</span> on
mountains and country labourers.&nbsp; Twm retaliates upon Dio
the devil, with whom he returns in triumph to Llandovery.&nbsp;
The lady of Ystrad Feen, and Twm&rsquo;s gallant service in her
behalf.</p>
<p>As they advanced on their journey, which was amongst a most
mountainous country, Twm expressed his wonder at seeing the
turf-cutters and haymakers following their avocations almost side
by side in this wild district.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried
he, &ldquo;I know that much has been said, sung and written, in
praise of mountain scenery; and where &rsquo;tis truly romantic
as well as wild, I am a great lover of it myself; but this is not
to my liking&mdash;it is too dead in its deserted appearance for
me.&nbsp; Here no sound salutes the ear but the lonely cry of a
few melancholy kites, hungry enough to prey upon one another; and
no object strikes the eye but the flat, tame desert, and a few
wretched cottages thinly scattered over this desolate region,
whose inhabitants are miserably employed in scooping peat from
the marsh for their fires, or cutting their bald thin crop of hay
from the unenclosed mountain&mdash;<i>the gwair rhos cwtta</i>,
or moor hay, which dispensing with the incumbrance of a cart or
sledge, the women carry home in their aprons, as the winter
maintenance of a half-starved cow.&nbsp; To me, there is nothing
that associates more with squalid poverty than turf fires: the
crackling faggot and the Christmas log, have their rustic
characteristics; coal has its proud and solid warmth; the
clay-and-culm fires of Cardigan and Pembrokeshire, formed of
balls, and fantastically arranged by the industrious hands of
fair maidens, are bright and durable, revealing the gay faces of
the cheerful semi-circular group&mdash;and above all, the
smokeless cleanly stone coal; but turf, smoky, ill-savoured,
ash-creating, dusty turf&mdash;recalls the marsh and moor,
rain-loaded skies, and fern-thatched cottages, <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>whose
battered roofs swept by the blast, discover the rotten rafters
grinning like the bare ribs of poverty; worse than all, the
joyless faces of the toil-bowed children of the desert.&nbsp; The
old stanza is quite to my mind when it says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How gay seems the valley with rich waving
wheat,<br />
Fair hands and fair houses, with shelters so neat;<br />
While the whole feather&rsquo;d choir to delight us conspires,<br
/>
There&rsquo;s nought on the mountain but turf and turf
fires.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And besides that,&rdquo; added Twm, &ldquo;I can give
you a few rhyming lines of my own, bearing in the same
direction.&nbsp; Here they are,</p>
<blockquote><p>Three things&mdash;to my mind each with loveliness
teems;<br />
A vale between mountains that&rsquo;s threaded by streams;<br />
A neat white-wall&rsquo;d cottage, &rsquo;mid gardens and
trees;<br />
And a young married pair that appreciate these.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Rhys, &ldquo;do not let us find
too much fault with these scenes, for the recollection of what
our mountain land has been, would induce me to kiss the sod of
its dullest region, when I remember how it became the refuge of
our war-worsted fore-fathers in the days of old, as the star of
liberty seemed to vanish for ever from our sphere.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The curate grew warm with his subject, and his eyes kindled with
enthusiasm as he proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could as soon twit my
beloved mother with the furrows which Time has ploughed on her
honoured brows, as censure the homeliest part of our dear
mountains, hallowed of old by the tread of freemen, when the
despot foreigner usurped the valleys.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Freedom, amid a cloudy
clime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Erects her mountain throne sublime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While natives of the vales and plains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are gall&rsquo;d with yokes and slavish
chains&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then shrink we ne&rsquo;er, unnerved as
bann&rsquo;d<br />
In the cloudy clime of the Mountain Land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turban&rsquo;d in her folds of mist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Mountain Land the sky has kiss&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While on her brow the native wreath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of yellow furze and purple heath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>The rural reign her vales command,<br />
And the freeman&rsquo;s sword of the Mountain Land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twm accepted the remarks of Rhys as rebukes, for his own
depreciatory observations on his native country, and was about to
clear himself from all suspicion of lack of nationality; when the
latter, looking up at the sun, declared the day so far advanced
that he must instantly mount his horse and ride with speed, so as
to meet the vicar of Llandovery at the place appointed; on which,
directing Twm on the route he was to take, he rode off and left
him to pursue his way at leisure.</p>
<p>Thus left alone, Twm prepared for a lengthened walk, and
pursued his way in thoughtful silence for many miles, but was at
length brought to a stand by the discovery that the way he trod
had ceased to be either a road or beaten path; and that he was
actually pacing the trackless mountain, with the disagreeable
conviction that he had gone wrong, without a clue to recover the
right way.</p>
<p>Taking a careful and critical view of the surrounding country,
he came to the conclusion that there must be a road through
<i>bwlch</i>, or gap, which he perceived dividing the mountains
at some distance.&nbsp; He entered it, and hastened on with the
utmost alacrity, till he came to a cottage on the road side,
opposite to which was an immense rick of turf, that at a distance
looked like a long black barn.&nbsp; He called at the cottage,
and asked if he was right in his route to Llandovery,
&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; squeaked a thin old man who met him at the
door, &ldquo;God bless you young man, you could not be more
wrong, as your back is to Llandovery, and you are making straight
for Trecastle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s face indicated his deep chagrin, as he listened to
the response, and the old man seeing him vexed, asked him to walk
in and rest himself, an invitation that he gladly accepted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What, I suppose you thought to be at Llandovery to hear
the great preaching there to-day?&rdquo; said the man&rsquo;s
wife, a little <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>fat woman who was carding wool by the fire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Twm, &ldquo;I never heard of any
preaching that is to be there.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
very odd,&rdquo; rejoined the old man, &ldquo;as the whole
country has been crowding there to hear the good Rhys Prichard,
the great vicar of Llandovery.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard
he is very popular,&rdquo; said Twm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Popular!&rdquo; screamed the weazon-faced old man, as
if indignant at the coldness of our hero&rsquo;s eulogy,
&ldquo;he is the shining light of our times, and hardly less than
a prophet; wisely has he called his divine book the
<i>Welshman&rsquo;s Candle</i>, for it blazes with exceeding
brightness, and men find their way by it from the darkness of
perdition.&nbsp; When it is known that his health permits him to
preach, the country hereabouts is up in swarms, to the distance
of two score miles and more.&nbsp; Then, the farmer forsakes his
cornfield, the chapman his shop, and every tradesman and artizan
quits his calling, to listen to the music of his discourse.&nbsp;
Infirmity alone has kept me from going to hear him to-day; but my
wife is no better than an infidel, and would rather listen to a
profane fiddler, or a vagrant harper, than the finest preacher
that ever breathed out a pious discourse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for any woman to listen quietly to, without
saying a word or two in reply, and his spouse assured Twm that he
was a miserable dreamer, whose brains had been turned by the
ravings of fanatical preachers; that some months ago he ran three
miles, howling, thinking he was pursued by the foul fiend, when
it turned out to be only his own shadow; and that when a patch of
the mountain furze was set on a blaze to fertilize the land,
nothing could convince him that the world was not on fire, and
the day of judgment come, till he caught an ague by hiding
himself up to the chin in the river for twelve hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Facts are stubborn things,&rdquo; and as these were
most unpleasant ones to be served up at his cost, for the
entertainment of a stranger, the old man&rsquo;s reply was angry
and indignant, and the war of words seemed likely to degenerate
into one of actual blows, when <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>the violent galloping of a horse
drew their attention, and in an instant a steed and rider passed
the door; but suddenly checking his speed he returned, and
calling at the cottage door, asking in a tone of authority if a
lady had passed that way towards Llandovery within the last half
hour.</p>
<p>The old man, trembling as he spoke, protested that no lady had
passed for many hours; on which the bluff horseman told him as he
valued his life, that neither he nor his wife should appear on
the outside of the cottage door till he gave them leave.&nbsp;
The old man assured him of his entire obedience, when the fellow
quietly crossed the road, and effectually concealed himself and
horse behind the opposite turf-stack.</p>
<p>This scene had received all attention from Twm, who had
recognized in the despotic horseman, his late dearly-remembered
friend, Dio the devil.&nbsp; He suspected Dio&rsquo;s intentions
and prepared forthwith to take part in some approaching business
in which his presence had not been reckoned upon.&nbsp; He asked
the timorous old cottager if he possessed such a thing as a
long-handled hedge bill-hook, to which the poor dotard, his teeth
chattering the while, replied in the negative.&nbsp; On searching
the cottage, with the assistance of his mistress, to his great
vexation he could find no weapon, but a blunt old hatchet, and a
rusty reaping hook.</p>
<p>While they were yet seeking, Twm&rsquo;s ear, sharpened to the
utmost by the excitement and impending danger, heard another
horse approaching, his heart caught fire at the sound, and with
almost fierce vehemence he called to the people of the cottage,
&ldquo;Give me some weapon in the name of God! to defend you and
myself from having our throats cut;&rdquo; but it only increased
their terror and confusion.</p>
<p>As he still spoke, there stopped opposite the cottage, a lady
on a beautiful white horse, and the horseman darted forward from
behind the turf-rick, and producing pistols demanded her
money.&nbsp; The lady protested, in the most piteous and earnest
tone, that she had accidentally left her purse behind and must be
indebted to <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>a friend at Llandovery, should she fail to meet her
husband there, for some small change.</p>
<p>A momentary thrill, mysteriously strange and unaccountable,
overcame our hero, as he caught a view of the lady&rsquo;s face,
and recognized one that he felt certain he had seen before; and
when, or where, he could not recollect; and the enquiring thought
was checked in its birth by the consideration of her present
danger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be disappointed for
nothing,&rdquo; cried the ruffian, &ldquo;Dio the devil is not to
be fooled, and my pretty lady of Ystrad Feen, I have depended on
a good booty from you to-day, so that unless in two minutes you
strip, and give me every article in which you are clothed, a
pistol bullet shall pass through your fair and delicate
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fair horseman begged for consideration, and promised a
liberal reward for any mercy shown to her.&nbsp; But the
scoundrel laughed scornfully in her face, and cocked his pistol,
on which she uttered a loud scream and fainted, when he
immediately approached to dismount, strip, and rifle her.</p>
<p>Our hero whose blood was boiling with honest indignation, now
started up from behind the lady&rsquo;s horse, and struck the
highwayman an astounding blow on the temples, with a stout
hedge-stake grasped with both hands, and repeated that delicate
treatment till it brought the desperado senseless to the
ground.&nbsp; After the first terrible blow, confused as he was,
he instinctively presented his pistol at random, but Twm struck
him heavily on the extended arm, which caused it to fall like a
withered oak branch smote by the thunderbolt.</p>
<p>In a few minutes the lady began to recover under the kind and
attentive treatment of the old woman, who bathed her face with
water.&nbsp; How Twm was rewarded by the deeply grateful
expression on her countenance!&nbsp; Truly he had delivered her
from peril, but into what a difficulty had he brought
himself!&nbsp; He was in love; over head and ears.&nbsp; The fair
one appeared to be still in dread of other dangers, but Twm, in
the gentlest manner, assured her of her entire safety, and that
he would have the happiness of conducting and protecting <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>her to
Llandovery, where he intended to bring the highwayman dead or
alive, and deliver him, with an account of the whole affair, to
the magistrate.</p>
<p>Poor Twm!&nbsp; The lady praising his courage, informed him
that she was the wife of Sir George Devereaux, and that her
husband would not allow his services to pass without pecuniary
reward.&nbsp; Poor Twm! in love with another man&rsquo;s wife,
and that man with an aristocratic handle to his name.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For my own part,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;as I assured
the merciless highwayman, I am at present without my purse,
having left it accidentally at the house of a poor sick person,
whom I relieved, and stayed with many hours this morning, by
which delay I have missed hearing the sermon preached to-day by
the Rev. Rhys Prichard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm declared he did not in the least feel himself entitled to
any reward; sufficient for him was the approval of so beautiful
and amiable a lady; but that he had another gratification in the
action he had performed, as it was his fortune to have punished
the man who had once stopped him on the highway and robbed him of
his little all.&nbsp; Our hero felt quite sure he had seen the
lady before, and in endeavouring to remember where, he fell into
a silent reverie; from which, however, he was suddenly roused by
the loud groaning of his wounded captive.</p>
<p>The fears of the old man had driven him beneath the rickety
old bedstead, and no threat nor offer of reward could induce him
to leave his retreat, where he lay exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh Lord! oh
dear!&nbsp; I shall surely have my throat cut.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
lady of Ystrad Feen, however, alighted and lent an active hand in
binding the thief, still insensible, with old halters contributed
by the fat woman of the cottage, who also gave all possible
assistance; so that with their united aid Twm soon got him across
his own horse, like a sack of barley, and secured him by tying
him neck and heels under the horse&rsquo;s belly.&nbsp; Our
elated hero leaped into the saddle, and rode side by side with
the lady of Ystrad <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>Feen, and conversing freely with her, no longer
embarrassed with his former bashfulness, till they reached
Llandovery.</p>
<p>The good people of the town were just leaving Llandingad
church, and were considerably astonished with what they saw, and
Twm and his fair companion were soon surrounded by a large and
curious crowd.&nbsp; Sir George Devereaux, a ruddy and hearty
fox-hunting Baronet, came up and assisted his lady to alight, Mr.
Rhys the curate approached Twm, and each in a few minutes was in
possession of the whole story.&nbsp; The baronet eagerly grasped
our hero by the hand, and assured him of his protection and
favour to the utmost of his power; declaring at the same time
that no possible reward could equal his deserts or repay his
services.</p>
<p>All were delighted to hear of the defeat and capture of Dio
the Devil, as, with very few exceptions, the farmers of that
district had suffered from the highwayman&rsquo;s depredations,
and a subscription was immediately raised, to reward the captor;
so that our hero was soon in possession of a sum of no less than
ten pounds, in addition to five more that the county awarded.</p>
<p>Twm and Mr. Rhys received an invitation to dinner for the
following day, at Ystrad Feen, where Sir George promised them
good entertainment, and added that they would decide in what
manner our hero&rsquo;s gallant service could be best
repaid.&nbsp; As for Dio the Devil, when the constables advanced
to unloose him, it was discovered that he was dead.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dead as a fox within the jaws of Juno!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sir George, as the lifeless robber fell heavily on the ground,
amid the crowd of spectators.</p>

174</span>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> remains at
Ystrad Feen.&nbsp; The vicar of Llandovery.&nbsp; A famous run
with the hounds.&nbsp; An enthusiastic hunter&rsquo;s leap.</p>
<p>Twm took up his abode, for the time, at a tavern recommended
by Mr. Rhys, where, being decidedly the hero of the day, he was
surrounded by a large company, all anxious to minister to the
bodily wants of so brave a fellow, and wishful to hear the
details of his desperate encounter with the famous robber, from
the lips of Twm himself.&nbsp; Cautioned by the worthy curate,
however, his potations were rather limited; and urging his
fatigue as an excuse for retiring, he soon left his admirers, and
slept on a bed of roses.</p>
<p>At an early hour Mr. Rhys awoke Twm, and told him that they
were invited to breakfast with the Rev. Rhys Prichard, who had
expressed a desire to see the brave young man that had captured
the highway robber.&nbsp; This invitation was the more acceptable
to Twm, as he was exceedingly anxious to see so celebrated a
character as the vicar of Llandovery; though no less for his
pious than his poetical celebrity, and more especially the
association of his name with his own family calamity, in the
death of his son Samuel, poetically called the &ldquo;Flower of
Llandovery,&rdquo; at the murderous hands of the young men of
Maes-y-velin, as before related.</p>
<p>Twm was desirous to change his country suit for something
better, and commenced negotiations with Mr. Rhys, for the
purchase of one of the latest clerical cut from him.&nbsp; The
worthy curate, however, cut him short, and generously presented
him with one a little the worse for wear, that as the mass of
mankind were apt to judge by external appearances, an appropriate
<a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>garb
would aid even a man of merit in making a favourable
impression.</p>
<p>The house of the vicar of Llandovery was among the best in the
town; a well built strong mansion, distinguished from all others
by a neat small cupola on the top, for a bell, to call the boys
to school.&nbsp; Twm and Rhys waited in the breakfast parlour
about half an hour, filling up the time by noticing and remarking
on the well-waxed oaken floor and furniture, that, with the
prints of some of the English martyrs, with which the room was
hung, gave it something of a gloomy appearance; and in skimming
over some dusty old volumes of divinity, till the clock struck
six.</p>
<p>The worthy vicar received his visitors with a few brief but
courteous sentences, in which he quietly yet earnestly expressed
his gratification at their presence.&nbsp; Breakfast was preceded
by prayers; after which came in bowls of milk and hot cakes, with
cold meat, butter and cheese, and ale.&nbsp; Twm looked at his
venerable host with awed reverence.&nbsp; This eminent character
was of a tall, stately figure; his hair white as wool, his face
pale, and rather long, with a countenance beaming with sedate
benignity.&nbsp; He regarded Twm for some time with silent
attention, and afterwards made a few enquiries respecting his
recent feat, which when answered, he indulged in some pious
ejaculations on the fortunate event.</p>
<p>Their host compared the physical capacity and appearance of
Twm to the well developed and robust figure of Dio the Devil, and
referred to the scriptural records of the combat between David
and Goliah; strictly charging the fortunate youth to take no
credit to himself for the achievement, as he was but an humble
instrument in a mighty hand, and for a special purpose unknown to
the actors of the scenes themselves.</p>
<p>All justice having been done to the good things before them,
grace was said, and Twm received some excellent advice from the
celebrated divine, who <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>placed twenty shillings and a copy
of his &ldquo;Welshman&rsquo;s Candle&rdquo; in the hand of Twm;
and after shaking him warmly by the hand, he saw the pair to the
door and bade them farewell.</p>
<p>In an hour or so afterwards, Rhys and Twm prepared for
departure to Ystrad Feen, the latter mounting the noble hunter
which Dio the Devil had so lately bestrode in all his arrogant
pride.&nbsp; The road was entirely over the mountains, through
diversified scenery of much interest.&nbsp; At times it ran above
the edge of a deep ravine; at others, hills overtopped them, in
peaks of various, fantastic forms; till a length succeeded the
tame and flat moorland, abounding with wild ducks and various
aquatic and mountain fowl.&nbsp; These scenes were soon left
behind, and others of a different character succeeded, tamed to
softer beauty by the indefatigable hand of industrious man.</p>
<p>Passing through a small ravine at the base of a well-wooded
hill, they emerged suddenly upon a view which embraces the rural
chapel of Boiley, the ornamented estate of Ystrad Feen, the hill
of Dinas, and a glimpse of the river Towey.&nbsp; The ancient
mansion of Ystrad Feen they found most romantically situated,
terminating a sloping descent from the mountain, with a roaring
alpine brook falling headlong through its rocky bed, at the back;
while the high conical hill of Dinas stood, an object of singular
beauty, in front; and the background was occupied by an almost
endless perspective of forest, vale and mountain.</p>
<p>They entered the farm-yard, which occupied one side of the
house, in which stood several large elms and oaks, and, here and
there, a huge hollow yew, that associated well with the antique
appearance of the house.</p>
<p>They were expected, for the baronet and his lady were awaiting
their arrival, and hastened, as they appeared, to give them
hearty welcome.&nbsp; It wanted about a couple of hours to dinner
time, which interim Sir George wished to fill up by introducing
them to his fox-hounds and pigs, while his lady urged <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>the
superior attractions of the lawn and flower-garden, to the terror
of the sporting baronet, who seemed to consider her taste not
only questionable, but absolutely depraved.&nbsp; Sir George
shook his comical head in a comical manner, inferring a protest
against their choice, when the young men decided on seeing the
garden first, and the kennel and pig-stye after; a preference
that seemed to involve an absolute inversion of the order of
things, apparently, to his thinking.</p>
<p>What a contrast there was between the lady of Ystrad Feen and
her lord and master!&nbsp; Twm&rsquo;s attention was almost
entirely taken up with the sweet and unaffected grace of the
lady; but we must be impartial and take some notice of her
husband.&nbsp; Sir George was a spare and somewhat tall figure,
the erectness of which was frequently disturbed by what at first
appeared some constitutional fidgetiness&mdash;a habit of
perpetually drawing up, and letting down, his right shoulder;
while he conversed in jerking short sentences, never standing
still an instant when speaking.&nbsp; These peculiarities, at
first sight, gave him the appearance of a man afflicted with St.
Vitus&rsquo;s dance; and affected the observer with the repulsive
sensations endured by those who, from delicacy towards the
afflicted, aim to conceal their notice of a personal blemish or
deformity.</p>
<p>But this strange habit had its source in a fox-hunting
accident that occurred in a chase wherein Sir George, in the heat
and ardour of the pursuit, leapt down a terrific precipice in
which the fox had sought cover.&nbsp; His noble hunter, named
Dare-devil, was killed by the achievement of this feat, his own
neck nearly broken, and his shoulder so dislocated and otherwise
injured, that no surgical skill could cure him of the nervous
affection which caused the continual restlessness alluded to.</p>
<p>Sir George, however, gloried in his dearly-bought triumph, and
boasted like a veteran detailing the particulars of a famous
battle in which he had figured; <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>winding up his narrative
with&mdash;&ldquo;glorious and remarkable hunt&mdash;the world
never saw the like&mdash;and I was solus in at the death&mdash;in
a hell-hole that none but myself dared approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face was no less curious than his figure.&nbsp; He was
rather small featured, with very light blue eyes; indeed so
exceedingly light that they were often described as literally
white; and when he gazed, with the wildness of imperfect
consciousness, caused by indulgence in the potent cup, might give
no inapt idea of Pygmalion&rsquo;s marble statue, on its first
wild stare when imbued with inward light and life; although his
merry neighbour, Squire Prothero, summed their description up,
less classically, as the nearest approach to a boiled
salmon&rsquo;s eyes, or the lack-lustre dullness of a couple of
baked gooseberries.&nbsp; His face was fair, and much freckled in
the upper part; while a shock head of closely-curling red hair,
and white, or rather sandy eyebrows, concludes the description of
this strange piece of eccentric manhood.</p>
<p>The walk through the garden was by no means to his
taste.&nbsp; He did not understand flowers, and could not
restrain his expression of impatience, protesting that there was
nothing worth seeing there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added
he, with the gravity of a philosopher who aimed to eradicate a
vulgar error, and instil a superior principle, &ldquo;flowers are
bad&mdash;a great evil&mdash;showy nuisance&mdash;bank of violets
often a snare to the hounds&mdash;like beauty to the boy, to lure
him from the paths of duty;&mdash;but come and see my
kennel&mdash;finest dogs in the world&mdash;no false charms
there&mdash;they say truth&rsquo;s hid in a well&mdash;all a
mistake&mdash;she&rsquo;s hid in the snouts of my
fox-hounds;&mdash;strong as bulls, and swift as hell&mdash;a
cannon ball&rsquo;s a fool to them&mdash;deadly as the doctor
wherever they rush&mdash;but what&rsquo;s your name, my young
C&aelig;sar of the Welsh mountains, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm was too busy with the lady of Ystrad Feen to listen to the
rattling tongue of Sir George, and Mr. Rhys hastened to give the
story of Twm&rsquo;s parentage, dwelling with much emphasis on
the cruel <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>neglect of his father, Sir John Wynn of Gwydir; and, in
conclusion, he said his friend&rsquo;s name, derived from his
humble mother as well as from his stately father, was Thomas ap
John a Catty, familiarized into Twm Shon Catty; but that which he
intended to adopt, and desired to be known by, was Thomas
Jones.</p>
<p>The promenade had, in the fox-hunter&rsquo;s opinion, been
unreasonably prolonged, and he hailed with delight their approach
to his sanctum sanctorum, the dog-kennel, where he anticipated
the delight of his visitors, when&mdash;how shall we express the
intensity of his disappointment!&mdash;a voice struck on his ear,
like the croak of the bird of ill-omen with the intelligence of
&ldquo;dinner waits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fain would he have horse-whipped the intruding messenger, and
expatiated with his friends on the absurdity of eating dinners,
when the sublimer pastime of entering a kennel of fox-hounds was
offered to them.&nbsp; But before he found words to his purpose
he had the mortification to see his auditors accompany his lady
wife into the house, where, musing on their questionable taste,
he followed them.</p>
<p>We need not dwell on the delicacy of the viands, the rarity of
the wines, the jocularity of Squire Prothero, the laughing
magistrate, who dropped in and joined them after dinner; the
beauty and fascination of Miss Meredith, the lady&rsquo;s
companion, who almost made a conquest of the heart of poor
Rhys&mdash;and, above all, the captivating sweetness of our
heroine, the young hostess! and other interesting details.&nbsp;
But we must find space to say that a short hunt was got up,
contrary to usual custom, in the evening, to save the baronet
from dying of chagrin for his failure of exhibiting his animal
treasures to his guests before dinner.</p>
<p>A young fox being started, our hero acquitted himself so
amazingly to the satisfaction of his host by the most daring
feats of leaping and yelling out, in the fox-hunter&rsquo;s
strain, &ldquo;yoy, yoy, hark forward, wind him Juno!&rdquo; and
many other such expressions, that Sir George in <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>the ecstacy
of his feelings almost wept in the contemplation of such a
promising genius, vowing that a year&rsquo;s tuition under his
first whipper-in would make him a truly great man, and a fit
companion of princes.&nbsp; Grasping his hand with the tenacity
of a blacksmith&rsquo;s vice, he vowed that from that moment he
had engrossed his name upon his heart, high on the list of his
most choice friends.</p>
<p>Sir George was not one who limited his friendship to
profession only; and, having learned from Twm his position in
life, he became desirous to aid him permanently, and put him on
the road to fortune, knowing right well that if he had only a
glimpse of it, that he was wide awake enough never again to lose
sight of it.&nbsp; He lost many nights&rsquo; rest in striving to
settle this knotty point, and at last determined that he should
live with him on the footing of a friend; indeed so necessary had
he become to him in his hunts, that he at length declared it was
impossible to part with him.</p>
<p>Thus, as an inmate of Ystrad Feen, Twm spent some of the
happiest days of his life, for the best part of this, and the
following year.&nbsp; Alternately hunting with the baronet and
reading with his lady, who called him her hero, and made him an
absolute show lion among her friends, Twm could not but feel
this, as a remarkable contrast to the wretched life passed at the
house of Morris Greeg.</p>
<p>Twm also enjoyed many happy hours with his staunch friend
Rhys, at the houses of the surrounding rural potentates, where,
on account of his brave reputation, and for his ready wit, so
unsparingly lavished by him wherever he went, he speedily became
a favourite.&nbsp; We shall close this somewhat long chapter with
the relation of one of these adventures which gave universal
satisfaction to his friends, and became the subject of remark and
wonderment for many a year.</p>
<p>Llandovery was just at this time honoured by a visit from a
London buck, who, thoroughly convinced of the utter darkness and
benighted state of that retired district, had charitably come to
reside amongst the <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>miserable inhabitants thereof, that they might know and
understand what civilization meant, as evinced in his own proper
and illustrious person.&nbsp; He took a very ungracious way of
teaching the important fact, for he did nothing but boast of the
immense superiority of everything appertaining to his glorious
self, and depreciate that which belonged to others.</p>
<p>Mr. Tomkins (that was his euphonious title) insisted that his
gun, his fishing tackle, his boots, the cut of his coat, and
everything that was his, was better than those belonging to any
body else.&nbsp; But if there was one object above all others
that engrossed his volubility, it was the praise of his horse;
daily did he ring the changes on his wonderful animal, his feats,
his beauty, blood, and pedigree, at every house where he
visited.</p>
<p>One day after dinner at Ystrad Feen, in company with the
baronet, Squire Prothero, our hero, and the ladies, he rudely
asserted the superiority of his own horse to any in that country,
when both our baronet and the squire seemed nettled at his
disparaging remarks, which, had he not been his guest, it is
probable Sir George would have resented.</p>
<p>He offered to wager fifty pounds that his horse should surpass
the best of theirs in running or leaping, be the given feat what
it might.&nbsp; Great and gratifying was their surprise when our
hero, with much emphasis cried &ldquo;done!&rdquo;&nbsp; Adding,
&ldquo;I have a mare of no very splendid exterior that shall
perform a feat, with myself on her back, that you and your
boasted hunter dare not follow for your lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done! for fifty pounds,&rdquo; cried the London buck;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll back him for a hundred, without knowing what he
is at,&rdquo; exclaimed the baronet; &ldquo;And so will I,&rdquo;
roared and laughed the excited Squire Prothero.&nbsp; With
unusual alacrity up rose all four, bent on having the bet lost or
won instanter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now hasten all together up the hill
towards Craig Ddu, and I will be with you in the cracking of a
whip,&rdquo; said Twm, as he hurried off in another
direction.&nbsp; The two neighbours looked at each other, and
wondered what would be the upshot <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>of this adventure; but, having all
faith in Twm, they attended the boastful Londoner to the place
appointed.</p>
<p>The summit of Craig Ddu (the Black Rock) was soon reached,
where they waited Twm&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; The town-bred buck
expressed impatience at the delay; adding with great complacency,
&ldquo;I intend, gentlemen, to teach this youngster a lesson that
he will not forget as long as he lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho,
ho, ho!&rdquo; laughed the portly Squire Prothero, &ldquo;take
care that he does not teach you one!&rdquo;&nbsp; Scarcely were
these words uttered when our hero appeared among them; but what
was their dismay, and the sneers of his antagonist, when they
beheld him mounted on a sorry old blind mare, scarcely worth a
dozen shillings!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do as I do?&rdquo; asked our hero,
addressing the Londoner, &ldquo;or forfeit fifty
pounds?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That I will, and something more
too!&rdquo; cried the buck, vauntingly, &ldquo;in which case the
forfeit of that sum will be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; replied Twm; and gradually facing his
animal towards a rising sward or ditch, that had been raised to
prevent the cattle from falling over the almost perpendicular
side of a deep ravine; &ldquo;Now for it then,&rdquo; cried he,
imitating the sound of a trumpet, and spurring his sorry jade,
&ldquo;neck or nothing for the fifty pounds!&rdquo; and at the
word the blind mare reached the ditch, and obedient to the spur
and rein, sprung over, and was out of sight in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God, he has gone to a sure death!&rdquo; cried
Prothero; the stout heart of the baronet (accustomed as he was to
such mad freaks,) seemed to have leapt to his throat and choked
his utterance, as he expanded his singular white eyes in a chalky
stare towards the spot of his disappearance.&nbsp; The party rode
forward, and, with the most thrilling anxiety looked down the
precipice.</p>
<p>Down at the bottom of the ravine, lay the poor old mare,
evidently having concluded a hard life by an equally hard
death.&nbsp; But they had no time for sympathy with the
unfortunate beast; they were too anxious <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>about its
daring rider to waste much consideration on it.&nbsp; Their
phrenzied eyes at length rested on the object of their search;
scarcely six feet beneath their standing place lay the redoubted
son of Catty, sound in wind and limb!</p>
<p>The baronet yelled a terrific <i>view halloo</i> that made the
old rocks echo with his dissonance, and the kind-hearted old
Prothero was so over-joyed at his safety that he actually failed
to laugh.&nbsp; Our hero, who had dexterously thrown himself off
at the critical instant that the mare sprung over, and fell, as
he had calculated, on a projecting ledge, which was thickly
covered with a mass of heath and long grass; so that, although
rather stunned, he was but little hurt.&nbsp; An instant&rsquo;s
delay in throwing himself off would have precipitated him to the
bottom, and the fate of the poor mare would have been his
own.</p>
<p>Great was the delight of his friends to see him rise, and wave
a handkerchief in token of his safety, and in a few minutes he
stood before his disconcerted antagonist, who had calculated,
from the appearance of the ground, that a race was the thing in
contemplation; but when the feat here narrated took place, the
pallid hue of his countenance evinced his inward feelings.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, sir, it is your turn,&rdquo; cried our hero, bowing
courteously to Mr. Tomkins, who looked paler and paler as he
peered down the declivity; and as his eye for a moment rested on
the dead mare in the bottom, his teeth chattered, and he turned
away shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no notion of such mad doings,&rdquo; muttered
the crest-fallen Mr. Tomkins.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you lose the
bet,&rdquo; cried Prothero; &ldquo;which I can afford to pay, as
well as any one here,&rdquo; replied the Londoner, in a tone of
haughty sulkiness, as he witnessed the applause bestowed on our
hero by the admiring baronet and his friend the squire.</p>
<p>Mr. Tomkins rightly arguing that he had lost caste by this
little transaction, had sense enough to leave the district and
take his departure for town, dispensing <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>with the
ceremony of bidding farewell to any of those country friends, of
whose hospitality he had so often partaken.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">The</span> Land of
Dreams.&nbsp; Twm&rsquo;s journey to London.&nbsp; A bet upon a
bull.&nbsp; Ready Rosser outwitted, and Squire Prothero&rsquo;s
fright.</p>
<p>When Twm had any leisure or reflection, his mind was occupied
with but one subject, so that at this period of his life he could
hardly be said to be a man of many ideas.&nbsp; This remark
applies only to the time when he indulged in retired country
rambles, or when he was in the solitude of his own
apartment.&nbsp; Confront him with any specimen of male humanity
extant, and his faculties returned in all their natural vigour,
and success generally attended his enterprises.</p>
<p>As before related, the moment he first set his eyes on the
remarkable and pleasing countenance of the lady of Ystrad Feen,
he felt a conviction that it was not the first time that he
experienced the pleasurable sensation that then pervaded his
whole soul.&nbsp; His continued intercourse with her during his
prolonged stay stubbornly maintained his first conviction that
they had met before; but when, where, and under what
circumstances, he could not discover.&nbsp; At length, when the
mind had been repeatedly fatigued with these vain tuggings at the
nerve of memory, although compelled by exhaustion to give up the
point, it was only for a season, to be resumed on the first
opportunity for putting his powers of recollection again into
practice.</p>
<p>After analyzing these mental enquiries with the closest
precision, he came to the successive negative conclusions, that
he could not possibly have seen her <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>either at Graspacre Hall, at Inco
Evan&rsquo;s, nor, most assuredly, at the cottage of his
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, where on earth else?&rdquo; muttered
he, wiping his moist brow, which was a little fevered by the
intensity of his labours in this mental research.&nbsp;
Determined, for his future ease, to dismiss the thought
altogether, he answered himself peevishly, &ldquo;nowhere,
surely, but in the land of <i>dreams</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, this chance thought provided him with the key so
long sought, to his remembrance of the face and form of his
charming hostess, for scarcely had he uttered those talismanic
words than they acted on his memory like Ithuriel&rsquo;s
spear;&mdash;the sentence fell like a flash of fire on the
touch-spring of the whole mystery, and flashed in full
effulgence, illuminating fully his long-darkened powers of
recollection!</p>
<p>Little had he thought of putting to himself what appeared so
vain a query, whether it was at Morris Greeg&rsquo;s home of
misery that he had beheld the never-to-be-forgotten face of
beauty and intellect&mdash;but at length he traced it!&nbsp; And,
of all places in the world, the most unfitting to be associated
with it&mdash;the murky hay-loft of Cwm y Wern Ddu: in short
mysterious still as the inference gave out, Lady Devereaux, in
every glance, feature, and movement, was indeed the spirit of his
glorious vision&mdash;the lady of his dream!</p>
<p>Thoroughly absorbed by this unexpected and most interesting
discovery, he forgot altogether the lapse of time, and was
startled by the sudden appearance of Sir George by his bed
side.&nbsp; The friendly baronet inquired with much concern, if
he was unwell, as they had been waiting breakfast for him full
half an hour.&nbsp; On being assured of the contrary, and that he
had only overslept himself, Sir George hastened down with the
glad tidings, as the whole family feared the consequence of his
temerity on the day before.</p>
<p>Our hero was soon among them, tendering his apologies, and
parrying the graceful banterings and rallyings of the ladies, who
rated him playfully for a sluggard and <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>a
lie-abed.&nbsp; The baronet soon recurred to the punishment
inflicted by our hero on the intolerable vanity and presumption
of the London buck.&nbsp; A knock at the parlour door checked the
current of his discourse, and, on permission being given, in
walked that little comical undersized fellow, familiarly called
Tommy Thomas, the second whipper-in, with a face of ruefully long
dimensions.</p>
<p>After a very worshipful bow, accompanied with many a bodily
turn and twist, while his fingers wandered among the regions of
his head and his whiskers, it turned out that honest Tom Thomas
came to report a calamitous visitation that had befallen this
very respectable house.&nbsp; During this worthy
functionary&rsquo;s absence at Llandovery, yesterday, (of course
his stay was not prolonged by his curiosity to examine the
quality of the different taps there!) he said that some audacious
villain had been to the stable, and stolen all the food which he
had purchased for the hounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What food&mdash;what food?&rdquo; inquired the baronet;
for everything was important to him that was in any way connected
with his darling hounds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why look you now, I wass py
an oil plind mare for ten shillings and two quarts of beer from a
travelling packman that wass sold off his goots, and not want her
agen; so I did pargen for hur, see you now, and wass paay for
hur, and dit put hur in te stapples, for foots for te hounce; and
look you now, some loucey peggar wass steal hur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the party except the baronet laughed heartily at this
intimation; but our hero soon relieved both Sir George and honest
Tommy Thomas, by informing the latter that his bargain was to be
found at the bottom of the Craig Ddu ravine; on which the poor
fellow joyfully withdrew.&nbsp; Twm immediately called him back,
and astonished him with the present of a broad piece, in company
with divers smaller silver coins, in acknowledgment that his
precious bargain had enabled him to win his bet from the
Londoner.</p>
<p>This was another piece of information for the baronet <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>and his
friends, and the cause of another explosion of triumphant
laughter, at the expense of their late nuisance, the bragging Mr.
Tomkins,&mdash;Sir George declaring that he had repeatedly
thought of asking the question as to how he had possessed himself
of the wretched animal; and now the mystery was amusingly
explained.</p>
<p>One long winter&rsquo;s morning, when the weather was so
stormy as to forbid all hope of being able to stir out for the
day, the baronet broke an unusually protracted silence by saying,
&ldquo;Mr. Jones, I have a favour to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad in my heart,&rdquo; replied Twm, &ldquo;for some
change to make any return for the favours I have
received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddle-de-dee with your favours! you talk like a
mountainer, lad,&rdquo; cried Sir George; &ldquo;balance against
us&mdash;owe thee much&mdash;Joan&rsquo;s life&mdash;thy merry
company; but how the devil to part with thee!&mdash;joy to thee,
this London&mdash;death to me&mdash;no fox-hunting, all smoke and
devilment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Devereaux came out and explained that Sir George had a
pressing necessity which he had long put off, of sending to
London a considerable sum, due to a certain Mr. Martyn, being the
last instalment of the purchase-money for some land bought of him
by our baronet.</p>
<p>Having just received an application for the cash, Sir George
was startled to find how much time had elapsed in the delay
caused by his aversion to going personally to London; for nothing
less would do in those days, except by a trusty messenger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;rt a lad of mettle, Twm, head as well as
heart,&rdquo; resumed Sir George&mdash;&ldquo;arms to fight, and
legs to run&mdash;roads full of thieves&mdash;can&rsquo;t fight
them all&mdash;out-wit them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm was at no loss to discover that the baronet was loth to
leave his family residence, his fox-hunting, and his
neighbours&rsquo; society, to encounter the perils and
discomforts of a journey to the metropolis, and that he was
wishful that Twm should go there as his representative, and
accordingly he declared himself <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>ready to commence his journey
whenever Sir George might please.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have a little fine weather first,&rdquo; replied
his engaging hostess, &ldquo;and in the meantime we will make the
necessary preparations for your departure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero gazed on her animated friendly face, with an
admixture of the romantic gallantry of the knights of old, and
the religious veneration of a devotee towards his patron saint;
for he felt that his fate was somehow mysteriously connected with
her influence, and never forgot that she was the spirit of his
glorious vision, the lady of his dream.</p>
<p>Squire Prothero&rsquo;s hearty laugh disturbed somewhat these
gentle reflections.&nbsp; He had just bought a bull and hired a
servant, and was in high glee at what he considered the
accomplishment of a favourable bargain.&nbsp; The bull, he said,
was a large and glorious white creature of the Herefordshire
breed, and the man a small black one, of the true Cardiganshire
runt description; but cunning as a fox, and keen as a kite.&nbsp;
A fellow, the worthy squire said, who was proverbially known in
the neighbourhood of Aberteivy for his exceeding shrewdness, by
no other cognomen than Ready Rosser.</p>
<p>Twm chuckled inwardly at his recollection of the swain whom he
had outwitted at Cardigan; and, in the hair-brain spirit that
often possessed him, longed to break a lance with this worthy
once more.&nbsp; As robbing the fields and hills was the
prevalent villainy of the period, and as Prothero, as well as
some of his neighbours, had been a considerable loser in numerous
instances, he was the more elated with his present
acquisition.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have now,&rdquo; quoth he, with the
usual accompaniment of a hearty laugh, &ldquo;a guardian for my
ox and my ass, my bull, and my bulwarks, and I defy the most
cunning thief in the country to ferret away my live things from
the custody of Ready Rosser of Aberteivy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll undertake to walk off with your bull,
in spite of Ready Rosser, if you&rsquo;ll leave it out three <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>nights, let
him do what he pleases,&rdquo; said Twm, with a confident
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; roared the merry Prothero, with a loud ho,
ho! that shook the room; but recollecting himself, he
added&mdash;&ldquo;but hark ye, my buck of bucks; my bull shall
not be left out to starve of these cold winter nights; he shall
be secured within the shelter of the cow-house, and if thou canst
abduct him from thence, within the three days and nights, welcome
shalt thou be to his carcase, and twenty pounds to reward thy
cleverness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried the baronet, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll
pay forty pounds for him if he fails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, three days and three nights is the time
given,&rdquo; cried Twm, &ldquo;as it will take two to get all in
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squire lost no time in communicating his wager to the
members of his household, and putting them on their guard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now mind,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;our friendly
antagonist is a sharp fellow, and you must sleep with your eyes
open during the next three days.&nbsp; Look out, Ready
Rosser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worthy thus addressed merely laughed at the impudence of
any one that could venture on such a bet.&nbsp; The emphasis
which Twm laid upon the period of three days was merely a <i>ruse
de guerre</i> of his, to throw his opponents off their guard, as
he fully intended commencing operations soon as darkness came
on.</p>
<p>The snow was thick on the ground; therefore, as the nearest
approach to invisibility, our hero arrayed himself in a white
frock and a cloth cap of the same colour, and sallied forth at
eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening, on a march of
observation.&nbsp; Having arrived at Llwyn-mawr, the residence of
Prothero, crossing the garden hedge, he coolly leaned over the
gate, and listening to the squire and his party in the adjoining
farm yard heard the whole plan of defence, as laid down by that
skilful Cardiganshire engineer, Ready Rosser.&nbsp; The white
bull the hero of the present wager, <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>had been placed in his stall for the
night, the door of the cow-house duly locked; and now the whole
party of farm servants, under the command of Rosser, were busily
employed by lantern light in forming the outward
fortification.</p>
<p>In the first place, four harrows were laid one upon the other,
across the entrance to the cow-house; on the upper harrow was
placed a heavy roller, then a new implement in Welsh farming, and
beside it two ploughs; the whole being surmounted by a sledge,
used in those days for a harvest cart.&nbsp; To make this sledge,
which was placed across the ploughs and roller, still more
unmovable, Rosser had it heaped with hay, duly trodden down,
carefully, as if intended for the foundation of a rick.&nbsp; His
last stroke of masterly management was to suspend to one of the
shafts of the sledge a large bell, which the squire, at the
request of vicar Prichard, had procured from Bristol, to ornament
the dome of his school, and to call the boys to their meals and
studies.&nbsp; Rosser shrewdly remarked that any movement of
these barricades, would be announced by its peal in the
night.</p>
<p>By nine o&rsquo;clock the whole party, including, the squire,
were wrapt in sound slumber, and the field was open to the
operations of our hero, who, in the meantime had returned to
Ystrad Feen, and brought back from thence the tools that he
required for the purpose.&nbsp; These consisted of an iron
crow-bar and a saw, a bag containing something, and little Tommy
Thomas for his <i>avante courier</i>, or look out, in case of
surprisal.&nbsp; Twm had observed that the cow-house was formed
of two pine-ends, substantially built of stone, while the back
and front, were on planks, nailed across horizontally.&nbsp; The
cunning Rosser had effectually fortified the front, where there
was a door, but entirely neglected the back, where there was
none; considering perhaps that the duck-pool or horse-pond, which
ran parallel the length of the lowly edifice, would prove a
sufficient rear-guard.&nbsp; <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>But greatly did that scheming wight
err in his estimation of the ingenious daring of his adversary;
for although three feet deep, black, and full of frogs and their
spawn, it was through the middle of this domestic lake, our Twm,
shouldering his crow-bar, made his way to commence the attack,
while Tommy Thomas occupied his post of observation on the top of
an old blighted oak stump.</p>
<p>To the great satisfaction of our hero, his onset was
auspicious; he succeeded without noise in wrenching off numerous
planks, and in a short time entered the building.&nbsp; He made
up at once to the grand object of his enterprise, and approached
the mighty brute with deference; then patting him kindly with a
patronizing air, he called familiarly by his name, which he had
learnt was Bishop, from the fair resemblance perhaps, of his
outward bull to the outward man of the lord of the lawn sleeves;
or, in his dignified rotundity, to some specimens of that
princely priest of our favoured land.&nbsp; Bishop having sniffed
and snorted a little, wondering at the temerity of the two-legged
animal that so daringly sought his acquaintance treated his
advances as due homage, and resumed his easy contemplative
posture, like a politic Autocrat that condescendingly gives
audience to a loyal peasant.&nbsp; Guessing the yearning of his
mighty mind, and no less mighty carcase, our hero presented him
with a small bag of oats, to conciliate his good-will, which
being graciously received, gave goodly omen of the magnanimity of
his disposition.</p>
<p>Twm now proceeded to his task of enlarging the opening for his
egress.&nbsp; After having heaved up, with his crowbar, two of
the uprights which formed the ribs of the old cow-house, from
which he had removed its sinews the planks, just as he was
enjoying his conquest over his worst obstructions, he found to
his dismay, that he had reckoned without his hostess, as Lady
Fortune claimed more from his exertions than he thought
due.&nbsp; A strong square heart-of-oak piece of timber ran
along, horizontally, the whole length of <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>the
building, which nothing but a saw could remove.&nbsp; As the
bull, Bishop, was too lordly and unaccustomed to diminish his
lofty altitude by dropping on his knees, like the meek docile
camel, and too stiff and heavy to spring like the active dog,
nothing remained but to remove in some way, the stout wood that
formed a bar across his furious-looking forehead.</p>
<p>As he considered the noise of sawing would rouse the
Philistines of Llwynmawr, for an instant Twm&rsquo;s inventive
powers were at a stand; but they soon rallied, and he how had to
strike a bold stroke, that promised anything but success, while
certain failure would otherwise be his lot.&nbsp; From the bag he
took two pairs of top-boots which he had provided, and drew them,
one at a time, with the toes pointing backward, on the feet of
the bull, Bishop, who seemed at first modestly to decline such an
unusual honour.&nbsp; But as Twm was very pressing, he meekly
submitted, like a bashful maid to don her wedding robes, or like
King Richard, to have fortune buckled on his back; for he in fact
endured to have his boots corded above his knees.</p>
<p>Twm now took the crow-bar to the front of the house, and fixed
it firmly through an old-fashioned iron ring in the farm-house
door, so as utterly to prevent the opening of it from the
inside.&nbsp; Fastening next a halter to the bell attached to the
sledge-shaft, he instructed Tommy Thomas to ring and roar
&ldquo;fire&rdquo; with all the strength of his arms and might of
his lungs; applying as he spoke, a candle to the hay on the
sledge, while he retreated to saw, amid this din, the stubborn
wood that barred alike the bull&rsquo;s departure and the
progress of the enterprise.</p>
<p>Whiz, crick, crack went the blaze! ding, dong! went the
clapper of the bell! fire, fire! roared the scare-crow voice of
little Tommy Thomas; Twm&rsquo;s saw being unheard through the
prevalence of these mightier sounds.&nbsp; The squire was the
first awakened by the unusual noise, and terrible was the fat
man&rsquo;s fright on seeing the blazing pyramid that illumined
the whole house inwardly, and all over the yard, while <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>he beheld
some little devil ringing the bell and roaring
&ldquo;fire!&rdquo; like a sergeant major while drilling a
battalion.</p>
<p>The activity of a fat man in a fright is truly
ludicrous.&nbsp; The nimbleness of the thinnest frightened tailor
that ever hid himself behind a fishing-rod, was mere sluggishness
compared to the flea-hopping trips of Squire Prothero, although
almost too large to conceal himself behind a church, in some
mountain parishes of Wales.&nbsp; Down stairs he rolled, ten
steps at a time, and tried in vain to open the outward
door.&nbsp; Up he rushed again, as if his unbreeched hams and
shirted shoulders had wings appended to them, to assist his
upward flight, bellowing &ldquo;fire! fire!&rdquo; till
hoarseness silenced him.</p>
<p>Just as he lost his voice, he found a deputy for it in a
broomstick, with which he ran into the men&rsquo;s room,
cudgelling Ready Rosser and the rest through the bed-clothes,
till they roared a dissonant chorus to the hoarse bass of
&ldquo;fire, fire!&rdquo; &ldquo;get up and be d&mdash;ned to
you, or be fried in your own tallow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the bell rung, and still Tommy Thomas lustily roared
&ldquo;fire!&rdquo;&nbsp; Ready Rosser, overwhelmed with fear and
stupidity, proved his name to be henceforth a misnomer, having,
with the rest of the clowns, utterly failed to open the
door.&nbsp; Running up stairs again, they met the squire at the
top, flourishing his cudgel like a flail about their heads.&nbsp;
In his extremity, to give poor Rosser his due, he tried the
notable plan of rising above his troubles by climbing up the
chimney; but when he had nearly attained the top, like many other
ambitious aspirants, he lost his footing, and tumbled down to the
bottom, blackened with soot, and smarting with his bruises.&nbsp;
At length this scene of confusion received a turn by the
adventurous daring of Gaby Snipe, a parish apprentice boy, who,
squeezing himself through a narrow casement, dropped to the
ground, and ultimately succeeded in removing the crow-bar and
opening the door.</p>
<p>During this scene of dire confusion, Twm&rsquo;s enterprise
had progressed swimmingly, and he had his worship the bull out of
the cow-house, through the <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>horse-pond, over the snow-clad
field, and into a lane that led to the parish road, which brought
them to a sheep-cot on the high mountain top, that almost
overhung the mansion Ystrad Feen.&nbsp; Just as he had bestowed
his precious charge within the aforesaid shelter, he was joined
by little Tommy Thomas, terribly out of breath with running and
laughing.&nbsp; Our hero had also his full share of laughter,
daylight having now pretty well advanced, in noting the paces of
the mighty brute as he stamped it along in his top-boots, with,
the toes reversed, being the first of the family, as he deemed,
that ever was honoured with such a dashing leg and heel
trimmings.</p>
<p>Tommy Thomas related that on the descent of Gaby Snipe, he
quitted his bell-rope and hid himself awhile to witness the
result of the outpouring from the house.&nbsp; The rush was
whimsical to witness, for fear, as usual, had exaggerated the
danger, and when in the yard they ran to and fro like scared
rabbits, not knowing what to do, nor what was required of
them.&nbsp; The hay being all consumed, and the fire
self-extinguished, Ready Rosser called out, &ldquo;water,
water!&rdquo; which, in their confusion and imperfect state of
wakefulness, they dashed, by pailsful, at one another, till at
length a general fight commenced in the farm-yard; and when the
squire came and parted them, not one could tell how the fray
began, any more than they could account for the stirring
incidents that had frightened them all out of their senses.</p>
<h2><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Philosophy</span> of
smiles.&nbsp; Twm sets out for modern Babylon.&nbsp; New use of a
pack-saddle.&nbsp; A gentleman of the road, and how Twm borrowed
his horse.</p>
<p>Laughter was the order of the morning at Ystrad Feen.&nbsp;
Grief causes the loss of the appetite, but mirth produced the
same effect in a different way on this particular occasion, as no
one seemed to have strength nor leisure to attack the tempting
delicacies spread before them in such profusion.&nbsp; Laughter,
loud, strong, boisterous, hearty ringing laughter, burst forth
again and again as Twm, in the drollest manner, excited their
risibility by a relation of what had passed the preceding
evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bull in boots!&rdquo; chuckled the Baronet, laughing
till the tears ran down his florid countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
bull in boots!&rdquo; cried the lady of Ystrad Feen, till a sweet
glow diffused itself over her whole countenance, developing, by
the effort a pair of the finest dimples that ever lent their
attraction to a female face.&nbsp; &ldquo;A bull in boots!&rdquo;
cried the Reverend John David Rhys, whose excited countenance
bore animated contrast to the &ldquo;pale cast of thought&rdquo;
that usually distinguished him, and with whom laughter was not
habitual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bull in boots!&rdquo; tittered Miss Meredith, with
something more than a simper, or small grin, used to exhibit a
fine set of teeth (which Parson Rhys thought peerless;) for
honest, hearty, spleen-dispersing laughter, was not voted to be
vulgar in those days; nor gentility and insipidity considered as
synonymous terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bull in boots!&rdquo; muttered a tall elderly
gentleman with a long saturnine nose, that seemed to curl away,
half disdainfully, from the mouth beneath it, which laughed,
however, in spite of the nose, inclining to extend itself from
ear to ear, in revenge for never having so indulged itself
before.&nbsp; &ldquo;A bull in boots!&rdquo; <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>repeated he
sneeringly; &ldquo;how ridiculous!&nbsp; I should have as soon
thought to see a pig in pattens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of this merriment, Tommy Thomas made his
appearance, to announce something; but catching the exclamation
of &ldquo;a bull in boots,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a pig in
pattens,&rdquo; was immediately infected with the general
contagion, and laughed and snorted like a pig in a hay-field,
when a cunning cur has suddenly seized him by the buttocks.&nbsp;
The new arrival promised additional fun, and all were prepared to
enjoy it.&nbsp; At length he explained himself in a brief
sentence, &ldquo;Mr. Prothero is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm now made a hasty retreat for some unexplained purpose; and
in a few minutes the portly figure of Squire Prothero was seen in
the yard, sitting on his horse, and laughing till too convulsed
to alight.&nbsp; The company ran out and greeted him, while the
good-natured squire co-mingled with their mirthful peals as
hearty a &ldquo;ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; as ever shook his jolly fat
sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh away, ho, ho, ho! laugh away,&rdquo; cried he,
&ldquo;I know I look an ass, after bragging up such a nincompoop
as my fellow against this young wag of yours.&nbsp; But where is
he? where is the young dog?&nbsp; I suppose my noble bull is
slaughtered by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tough steaks he gave us for breakfast,&rdquo; cried the
baronet, &ldquo;tough as an alligator with his scales
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine fun if he had choked you all! but never
mind!&rdquo; returned the squire, &ldquo;a joke is a joke, and a
bet is a bet; and I have come to pay mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had he uttered these magnanimous sentiments, that
proved him worthy of the Grand Master&rsquo;s chair in a society
of laughing philosophers, than the booted bull, Bishop, gravely
approached, with our hero on his back.&nbsp; A fresh explosion
now burst from the party, to note the stately and apparently
conceited paces of the buskind king of the kine, who now wore his
boots with toes foremost, like any other gentleman; but none
laughed so heartily as Prothero himself, who seemed in raptures
to find his bull unbutchered.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>&ldquo;This fellow would tame a fiery dragon,&rdquo;
quoth he, &ldquo;aye, and ride him through the air, too, without
fear, or he could never have coaxed Bishop into such a good
humour as to become a steed for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole party now entered the house, and Prothero narrated,
to their boundless amusement, their ultimate discovery of the
bull&rsquo;s abduction.&nbsp; Rosser and his fellows had been
sent in a body to trace the foot-prints of the bull in the snow,
and recapture him if possible; but as such signs were utterly
invisible, Rosser returned in the utmost dismay, with a face half
a yard long, from the effect, he said, of a new light that had
just broken in upon him.&nbsp; With great solemnity, he declared
his conviction that the supposed bull was no beast at all, but
the devil in disguise, as not a print of his hoof was to be found
anywhere, although four set of human feet were traceable,
backwards and forwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was no bull,&rdquo; said the wise Rosser;
&ldquo;it was a devil which, after kicking down the cow-house,
and firing the hay with his brimstone breath, flew away in a clap
of thunder, which indeed I heard myself, as plainly as I hear my
own voice at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all these abominable bounces,&rdquo; quoth the
squire, &ldquo;I called him a liar and a fool, when the fellow
turned upon me with &lsquo;the devil take the bull! you
didn&rsquo;t think I could keep him in my pocket!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now the whimsicality of the idea of a fellow&rsquo;s pocketing a
bull, tickled me so much that I forgave him
everything!&rdquo;&nbsp; Another chorus of the trebles and bass
aforesaid burst out again, and, at the conclusion, the ladies
declared they had almost laughed themselves into illness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, fair ones, let the stay-laces
crack&mdash;cut them asunder, and give the lungs and laughter
fair play!&rdquo; cried the squire; closing his period with as
hearty a &ldquo;ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; as usually formed the climax
of his sayings and doings.&nbsp; In the present instance the
elderly gentleman chimed in with him, and <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>exclaiming,
&ldquo;droll as ever, Prothero, but now outwitted by a mere
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Sir John, (your pardon for the omission of my
respects thus long),&rdquo; cried the squire, as he cordially
shook his hand, &ldquo;but such a boy as our combined manhood
here never met with before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worthy here referred to, and before noticed as the
gentleman with the saturnine nose, was no less a personage than
Sir John Price, Baronet, of Priory House, Brecon, the highly
respected father of Lady Devereaux.&nbsp; He had arrived the
preceding evening, about the time that Twm commenced his attack
upon the bull.</p>
<p>Lady Devereaux explained to her father the great and gallant
services which she had received at Twm&rsquo;s hands, and her
statement was made in the most earnest and impassioned manner, as
if her gratitude was as great as on the day she was attacked by
Dio the Devil, and rescued by our hero.&nbsp; Sir John Price at
once rose from his chair, in a way that strongly contrasted with
his usual cold and ceremonious habit, and extending his white,
diamond-ringed, aristocratic hand to Twm, assured him of his
friendship and protection in all things wherein he could serve
him.</p>
<p>Twm would not accept the money which Prothero tendered in
liquidation of his bet.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the
successful champion, &ldquo;it was all for fun and amusement, and
you will allow that we have had some enjoyment out of it, and all
I ask is that, when I am far away, and you are brought face to
face with your well-prized bull, Bishop, you will think of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The generosity of his sentiments met with the encomiums of all
present; and the worthy squire reluctantly consenting to receive
back his bull without fee or fine, absolutely insisted on leaving
the forfeited twenty pounds in the hands of Lady Devereaux, who
received it accordingly.&nbsp; Recollecting the manner in which
he had been hunted from Tregaron, it was truly gratifying to his
feelings, and flattering to his pride, to hear persons of the
rank of the present company express <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>their regret that he was to leave
them the next morning.</p>
<p>The following day was the one appointed for Twm&rsquo;s
departure to London, and he arose with a sorrowful heart, (for he
was thinking of the lady of his dream,) to make a preparation for
his departure.&nbsp; The baronet having presented him with a sum
of money for his expenses, insisted on his leaving behind him,
with Lady Devereaux, whatever cash he possessed, till his return;
while the lady herself, playfully promising to be a faithful
banker, threw on his neck a heavy golden chain, as her
present.&nbsp; Twm had often seen her wear it; and fervently
kissing the splendid article, returned it to her keeping till his
return.</p>
<p>If anything could add to his satisfaction, it was to
experience the attention of his two fast friends, Rhys and the
Squire, who even at this early hour had hastened to bid him
farewell.&nbsp; Right glad was he of the opportunity of sending
some cash to his mother, and to remit what he had borrowed from
his friend, Cadwgan.&nbsp; In the yard, he had to receive the
good wishes and parting civilities of every man and maidservant
in the establishment, particularly of the huntsman and the
whippers-in, with whom he had become an amazing favourite.</p>
<p>It had been concerted that his best mode of travelling
<i>incog.</i> would be on a mean horse, with a pack-saddle, and
disguised as a lowly country lad.&nbsp; Thus mounted and
accoutred, behold him at length disappearing through the
yard-gate of Ystrad Feen; the cash and papers entrusted to his
care having been studiously concealed about his person.&nbsp;
Although but ill-contented with his homely harness, he found his
mountain pony, like his race in general, far better than his
looks promised; so that he rode on with a heart full of glee,
proud of the honours which he had gained, and glowing with bright
anticipations of the future.</p>
<p>Through his native principality, his journey was interesting
enough, so we need not note the scenes, which, <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>however
charming in their rural beauty and romantic wildness to Twm,
would lose most of their attraction in mere description.&nbsp; He
jogged on steadily and perseveringly till he had left Bristol
behind, and he had even passed through Bath and Chippenham before
a single adventure occurred worthy of record.</p>
<p>Riding late one evening, between the last-named town and
Marlborough, he found it necessary to put up at a small
public-house on the road-side, distinguished by the sign of the
&ldquo;Hop-pole,&rdquo; the obscurity of which he considered
favourable to his safety.</p>
<p>Having fed his beast and eaten his supper, he went immediately
to bed; and, with a view of preserving his treasure in the best
manner, slept without divesting himself of his clothes.&nbsp; He
had slept some hours, and day was just breaking, when he was
aroused by the trampling of a horse, and the gruff voice of a
traveller whom he heard alight and enter the house.</p>
<p>A strong impulse of curiosity determined him to rise from his
bed; and, as the large treble-bedded room which he occupied was
over the parlour, to which the guest was introduced, he listened,
to learn whether anything portended danger to himself.&nbsp; He
found, to his surprise and dismay, that he was the subject of
conversation between the landlady and her guest, whom he
discovered to be no other than the very character of which he
stood most particularly in peril&mdash;a highwayman.</p>
<p>He had heard himself described to him by the landlady, as an
uncouth booby of a countryman from the Welsh mountains, miserably
mounted on a piece of animated carrion, for which the crows cawed
as it limped along; and what booty was to be expected from such a
beggar inquired she?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong, mistress, you are quite wrong,&rdquo;
cried the stranger; &ldquo;from your account I expect much from
him.&nbsp; I have robbed more than one such, dressed like a
scarecrow, while making for London, and bearing with him the
twelvemonth&rsquo;s rent of half-a-dozen of his neighbours to pay
the landlord in town.&nbsp; I shall be <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>at this
fellow as soon as he quits your roof; I have no doubt but what he
is a prize, and if he is, you of course come in for
shares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having learnt thus much, Twm, in some trepidation, retired to
his bed, and began to consider how he should contrive, in order
to preserve the property in his possession.&nbsp; He rose again,
thinking to escape through the window, but found it too small to
admit his egress, and therefore gave up the idea.</p>
<p>As he looked out through the miserable casement, busily
plotting to hatch a scheme of deliverance, he could perceive no
favourable object to aid his purpose except a large pool on the
road-side, in which he thought of dropping his cash if he could
reach it, and do the act unobserved, so that he might recover it
at his leisure.</p>
<p>As nothing better offered, he determined to adopt his plan
immediately; and therefore, after making a studied clattering in
putting on his shoes, he went down stairs, and called for a jug
of beer and toast for his breakfast.&nbsp; The freebooter did not
show himself, but the landlady and her daughter, who seemed to be
in the habit of sitting up all night to receive and entertain
such guests, scrutinized our hero very closely.</p>
<p>The worthy hostess asked him some apparently careless
questions respecting his business in travelling the country, to
which he replied he was trying to overtake a brother pigman, who
was driving their joint charge to London.</p>
<p>While at breakfast, Twm&rsquo;s brain showed him another
project for securing his valuables, which he considered an
improvement upon the pond scheme.&nbsp; To give a more clownish
character to his manners, the night before, he had carried the
old pack-saddle up stairs, brought it down in the morning, and
while at breakfast sat on it before the fire, instead of a
stool.</p>
<p>It occurred to him that this peculiarity of his would have
been attributed to other motives, and that, no doubt, the honest
inmates of the place thought that he would not have exhibited
such care for his pack-saddle <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>if it were not worth more than it
looked.&nbsp; He was ultimately convinced that they had decided
that all his treasure was contained therein.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was not a bad idea, for he could then sit on it all
day and make a pillow of it by night.&nbsp; He determined to
encourage their suspicions; accordingly, bursting a hole in the
fore end of it, he called the landlady to receive her reckoning,
and in her presence, pushing his fist into the straw cushion of
the pack-saddle, he drew out several pieces of gold, and asked
her if she could give him change; but she answered in the
negative, on which he again thrust his hand into the pack-saddle,
and brought out more gold and silver intermixed; and with the
latter settled his bill, and went to the stable for his
horse.</p>
<p>Securing all his money about his person, he mounted his
Rosinante.&nbsp; Having cut away the girths from the pack-saddle,
he bade the landlady farewell, and rode with all his might
towards the pool, which was about a quarter of a mile forward on
the road.&nbsp; He soon heard the highwayman brushing forward in
his rear, with many oaths calling on him to stop, a summons that
increased our hero&rsquo;s speed, till, being opposite the pond,
his pursuer overtook him.</p>
<p>Twm rode to the edge of the water, and threw the pack-saddle,
with all his strength, towards the centre of the pool; but in
bustling to regain a steady seat as he made towards the road, he
fell headlong from his horse.&nbsp; The free-booter cursed him
for a Welsh fool, and with a thundering voice ordered him to hold
his horse, or he would blow his brains out, (brandishing his
pistol all the while,) that he might go into the water to recover
the booty.</p>
<p>Twm appeared to be frightened out of his senses, and trembled
with very visible terror as he approached to do the
robber&rsquo;s bidding; but no sooner had the highwayman reached
the centre of the pool, and began groping about for the object of
his search, than Twm, with one spring, mounted his fine tall
horse, and rode away with all his might.</p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>So
far all went well; but, to Twm&rsquo;s unspeakable horror, the
knight of the road, finding himself thus tricked, placed his
fingers in his mouth and gave a loud whistle, on which his horse
immediately stopped quite still.</p>
<p>Twm, in real terror, as he was within pistol-shot, roared
&ldquo;murder!&rdquo; with all his might; when the horse, to his
great amazement, took his exclamation of terror for a counter
order, and again started into a gallop.&nbsp; The freebooter
repeated his whistle, and again the horse stood still as a
mile-stone: Twm reiterated &ldquo;murder!&rdquo; with all the
power of his lungs; and the well-taught horse instantly resumed
his gallop.</p>
<p>Thus the highwayman&rsquo;s whistle and Twm&rsquo;s roaring of
&ldquo;murder!&rdquo; had an alternate effect on the noble
animal, till at length, our hero got completely out of hearing of
the baffled robber.&nbsp; As he rode on triumphantly, he sang the
old Welsh pennill or stanza&mdash;<a name="citation203"></a><a
href="#footnote203" class="citation">[203]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No cheat is it to cheat the cheater<br />
No treason to betray the traitor:<br />
Nor is it theft, but just deceiving,<br />
To thieve from him who lives by thieving.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he rode into Marlborough, in the highest spirit, one of the
church chimes was playing &ldquo;See the conquering hero
comes!&rdquo; which appeared to him to be a singularly
appropriate greeting, and which he accepted as a personal tribute
to his ingenious trickery upon the highwayman, whom, Twm secretly
hoped, had not yet got out the old pack-saddle from the pool.</p>
<p>How Twm laughed when he pictured to himself the rage and
dismay of the villain when he discovered its contents!&nbsp; That
was a thought to chuckle over and enjoy.&nbsp; It would extort
many a boisterous &ldquo;ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; from old Squire
Prothero, when he should have the pleasure of giving him the
story.</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>He
received great commendation at the inn where he stayed for the
night, when he related his adventure; and many of the inhabitants
were loud in their congratulations to the young Welshman, who had
so cleverly outwitted the English highwayman.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Watt</span>, the
mole-catcher, in a pleasant mood.&nbsp; Twm hears of his old
love, Gwenny Cadwgan.&nbsp; Tom Dorbell, and his feats.&nbsp;
Another adventure with a knight of the road.</p>
<p>Twm had reason to be satisfied with his progress on his road
to London, for he had met danger, and his wit and ingenuity had
proved equal to any emergency.&nbsp; But success did not make him
over-confident, and consequently careless; but, on finding
himself yet seventy-four miles from his journey&rsquo;s end, he
prepared for more trials of his skill and courage.&nbsp; He was
sent for next morning by the mayor of Marlborough, who had heard
of his adventure, and required to bring the horse with him, which
he had so adroitly won.</p>
<p>Many gentlemen having assembled at the entrance to the
town-hall, our hero appeared in all the pride of a conqueror,
mounted on his goodly steed; although so humbly clad, their hats
were doffed, and loud shouts of applause were immediately
given.&nbsp; It was soon ascertained by the mayor and the
gentlemen present, that the horse was regularly bred to the road,
and instructed by a highwayman, therefore, not, as at first
conjectured, the property of any person deprived of it by one of
these free-faring gentry; consequently, his worship, with many
comments on his cleverness and courage told our hero that the
horse was his own by right of <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>conquest; but that if he were
inclined to part with it, he would give forty pounds for it Twm
directly assented; and the money was paid to him the same
morning.</p>
<p>Being now in want of an animal on which to continue his
travel, Twm determined to walk on to Hungerford, and purchase one
nearly like the one he had set out upon at the commencement of
his journey, as he was still of the same opinion, that the less
temptation in his outward appearance to the gentlemen of the
road, the less likely were they to interfere with him.</p>
<p>About three miles out of Hungerford, he saw before him a
pig-drover, with a large herd of porkers, that he alternately
cursed in his ancient British tongue, and cut up with a whip;
while at intervals between these amusing recreations he loudly
sang, or roared, certain scraps of Welsh songs.&nbsp; Twm&rsquo;s
ear was quick in recognizing the well-known voice, and he soon
stood side by side with his old friend Watt the
mole-catcher.&nbsp; After mutual expressions of wonder and
congratulation, Twm immediately asked him how his mother was, as
well as farmer Cadwgan and his daughter Gwenny.</p>
<p>Watt replied that his mother and her husband were well; but
instead of answering the latter question, enquired his adventures
since he left Tregaron.&nbsp; Twm, with animated vanity, ran over
that bright portion of his history, occasionally heightening the
colour of events, according to the general practice of
story-tellers, from time immemorial; dwelling particularly on his
fortunate preservation of the lady of Ystrad Feen, and the
benefits which accrued to him in consequence, from the liberality
of Sir George Devereaux, whose confidential agent he then was, on
business of the utmost importance, to London.</p>
<p>These extraordinary events were intended by Twm to astonish
the sulky-looking mole-catcher, Watt, who was not in an
impressionable mood; but Twm, nothing daunted, still ran on,
saying, in allusion to his &ldquo;friend&rdquo; Sir
George,&mdash;&ldquo;Well, Watt, were he ten times as rich and
happy as he is, I should never envy him any <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>thing he
possessed, but one lovely piece of property.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; asked Watt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;could I once forget
poor Gwenny Cadwgan, which I never can, I should envy him the
possession of his charming young wife, the beautiful lady of
Ystrad Feen&mdash;the finest, the handsomest, and cleverest woman
I ever saw! and although now married to a second husband, she is
little more than one-and-twenty years of age.&nbsp; But I was
asking of my old sweet-heart Gwenny, poor Gwenny
Cadwgan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Gwenny Cadwgan indeed!&rdquo; echoed Watt.</p>
<p>The sneering manner in which the mole-catcher spoke this,
alarmed our hero; &ldquo;What of her, Watt?&rdquo; cried he
eagerly; &ldquo;is anything the matter? tell me quickly, for
Heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;&nbsp; Watt replied evasively, that
great trouble had come to both her and her father, in consequence
of their having harboured him when the hue and cry was up.&nbsp;
That fact, he said, was discovered a few days after his
disappearance, by old Rachel Ketch, who sold the secret to the
Squire for the highest price she could get; and would have sold
her own soul on similar terms to the Devil himself.</p>
<p>Twm observed Watt writhing as he spoke, and struggling
inwardly, with some terrible feeling, that for awhile deprived
him of utterance.&nbsp; He noticed with regret the deep furrows
of worldly care on his cheek, so lately ruddy and mirthful; and
thought he observed a sinister expression in his sunken eye and
trembling lips, that now were paler than his sallow face.&nbsp;
Fiercely resenting the closeness of our hero&rsquo;s scrutiny by
an assumption of rude abruptness, he said &ldquo;but why do I
waste time in talking here, when&mdash;but I must be
off&mdash;good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have not told me of Gwenny and her
father,&rdquo; quote Twm, in amazement at his demeanour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is soon told,&rdquo; replied Watt, pettishly;
&ldquo;the squire turned him out of his farm, and made so many
claims one sort or other, that Cadwgan was beggared, and left him
so poor that he could scarcely take a cottage for himself and
daughter.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t let him <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>mine, he
would have had none.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;
exclaimed Twm, &ldquo;thy hovel for farmer Cadwgan and the gentle
Gwenny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; replied Watt, with a lowering brow;
&ldquo;is he not a day labourer? it served me <i>when I was
one</i>, for many a bitter day.&nbsp; His daughter too, the
dainty Gwenny, she was too good for me&mdash;turned with scorn
from poor Watt the mole-catcher&mdash;but never mind! she was a
bit of a sweet-heart of thine too, Twm, I remember; but set thy
heart at rest, lad, if she won&rsquo;t be mine, she will never be
thine, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was uttered in a tone of bitter sarcasm, that both
surprised and enraged our hero; especially when he thus learned
from his own mouth that Watt had sought to win the affections of
the fair and generous Gwenny Cadwgan.&nbsp; He
replied&mdash;&ldquo;Well, the devil take thee when he will, for
he must have marked thee for his own, long since, or thou wouldst
never have had the impudence to court Gwenny Cadwgan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Watt, with a bitter snarl;
&ldquo;she will never be thine nor mine! so don&rsquo;t burden
thy memory with one who has already forgotten thee.&nbsp;
Farewell! and better luck with thy next sweet-heart!&rdquo;&nbsp;
With that he cracked his whip and drove on his herd of swine,
with an air of excited fierceness that was actually fearful to
witness.</p>
<p>So much hurt was Twm at the bearing and conduct of Watt that
he allowed him to go without asking more questions.&nbsp; His
sorrow to hear of the change in the fortunes of Cadwgan and his
lovely daughter, threw a heavy cloud over his mind; and he
regretted that his remittance to him, by the hand of his friend,
was so small.&nbsp; He felt rather relieved by the reflection
that however small the sum was, it would be deemed a
&ldquo;God-send&rdquo; to them under present circumstances; and
at the same time prove to friends that he was not unmindful of
them, nor ungrateful for their boundless kindness in his dark
days of peril.&nbsp; However, he felt somewhat embittered by the
<a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>insinuations of Watt, that the fair Gwenny&rsquo;s
regard for him was on the wane, if not altogether given to
another; and right glad would he have been to learn the exact
bearing of the whole affair, at which the mole-catcher&rsquo;s
hints but darkly hinted.</p>
<p>Twm was detained at Hungerford for some days, by starving
weather; and while looking about for another animal, was taken by
an old pedlar, down a green lane, to a creature of his, left
there to graze.&nbsp; He was not a little surprised to find it to
be his own pony, left in exchange with the highwayman, having on
his back the identical pack-saddle in which he had formerly
concealed his money.&nbsp; Twm made a purchase of both, and the
next morning took his departure from Hungerford.</p>
<p>His enforced leisure at Hungerford had not been unprofitably
spent, for he had listened attentively to the conversation of the
different drinking parties at the tavern where he stayed; and
found the dangers of the road to be the general theme.&nbsp; The
great hero of the turnpikes at this time, was a certain knight of
the road called the Gallant Glover, alias Tom Dorbell, originally
a leather-breeches maker and glover.&nbsp; It appeared that he
was a man who, by his shrewdness in general, as well as
particular instances of cunning, combined with his dauntless
daring, had become so much an object of admiration to those who
had nothing to lose, as of terror to the men of money, who had
become the victims of his audacity.</p>
<p>The following anecdote of him, told by one of these tavern
worthies, interested our worthy much, and had the effect of
putting him on his mettle, in case of an accidental meeting with
him during his journey.</p>
<p>It seems, a gentleman&rsquo;s son was taken for robbing on the
highway; and as he had been formerly pardoned, he despaired of
mercy a second time.&nbsp; Upon this, Tom Dorbell opened a treaty
with his wealthy relatives, and undertook, for five hundred
pounds, to bring him off.&nbsp; It was stipulated and agreed to,
that one half of that sum be paid in hand, and the other half <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>when the
deliverance was effected.&nbsp; On the trial of the young
gentleman, he was found guilty; but just as the judge was about
to pass sentence, Tom Dorbell cried out &ldquo;Oh! what a sad
thing it is to shed innocent blood!&rdquo; and continuing to
reiterate the expression, he was apprehended, and the judge asked
him what he meant by such exclamations, he
answered,&mdash;&ldquo;May it please your Lordship, it is a
dreadful thing for a man to die wrongfully; but one may see how
hard-mouthed some people are, by the witnesses swearing that this
gentleman now at the bar robbed them on the highway, at the time
stated in the indictment, when, indeed, my Lord, I was the person
who committed that robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly the &ldquo;Gallant Glover&rdquo; was taken into
custody, and the young gentleman liberated.&nbsp; Being brought
to trial the following assizes, to the astonishment of the court,
he pleaded not guilty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not guilty!&rdquo; exclaimed
the judge in a voice of thunder, &ldquo;did you not at the last
assizes own yourself guilty of the robbery in
question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Tom Dorbell, as meek
as a mouse, &ldquo;how far I was guilty then, but, upon my word,
I am not guilty now; therefore, if any person can accuse me of
committing such a robbery, I desire them to prove the
same.&rdquo;&nbsp; No witnesses appearing, the Gallant Glover was
of course acquitted.</p>
<p>What Twm had heard about the Gallant Glover and his
achievements, warned him that fresh trials on the road awaited
him; but he was no &ldquo;Bob Acre,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;screwing
his courage to the sticking-point,&rdquo; he manfully resumed his
journey.</p>
<p>He had got within ten miles of Reading, in Berkshire,
anxiously hoping to reach it without disaster, when the sudden
discharge of a pistol, close to his ear, convinced him that he
was in the centre of danger.&nbsp; Instantly a horseman, well
mounted, rode fiercely down a lane that entered the road, and
ordered him to stop and deliver in a minute, or have his brains
scattered on the hedge beside him.</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>&ldquo;Catch a weasel asleep!&rdquo;&nbsp; You might do
that, but to surprise Twm Shon Catty when he had reason to be on
the alert, was almost impossible.&nbsp; Assuming an air of
clownish simplicity, he replied, &ldquo;Lord bless ye master, I
ha gotten nothing to deliver but an old testament, a crooked
sixpence, and a broken fish-hook,
and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what, you
prevaricating young scoundrel!&rdquo; roared the
highwayman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, this purse,&rdquo; continued Twm,
&ldquo;which uncle Timothy gave I to market for him, and pay his
bills at Reading to-morrow;&rdquo; producing at the same time an
old stocking, which he had stuffed with old nails and cockle
shells, in order to make a jingle. <a name="citation210"></a><a
href="#footnote210" class="citation">[210]</a>&nbsp; The robber
made a grasp at the supposed well-stocked purse, which Twm
dexterously evaded, and flung it over the hedge into the
adjoining field, riding on; while the former instantly alighted,
blustering out a string of oaths and threats as he made his way
to the field to search for the coveted treasure.</p>
<p>Twm was, of course aware that as soon as the robber had
discovered how he had been tricked, that he would doubtless ride
after him, and in his rage, shoot him on the spot.&nbsp; As
Twm&rsquo;s poor pony would have no chance in a race with the
highwayman&rsquo;s high-spirited charger, he determined that a
daring act, if carried out successfully, would both ensure his
safety and prove profitable to him likewise.&nbsp; The knight of
the road, when he alighted, had thrown his bridle over a
hedge-stake; so Twm, abandoning his pony for the second time,
watched the robber into the field, crawled along the ditch till
he reached his horse, which he <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>instantly seized by the bridle,
mounted and rode off in a hot gallop, till he got safe into the
ancient town of Reading, as the clear-toned bells of St. Lawrence
were chiming their last evening peal.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">A <span class="smcap">gracious</span>
Lawyer.&nbsp; Twm determines to &ldquo;pedestrianize&rdquo; a
bit.&nbsp; Watt&rsquo;s horrible tale.&nbsp; A fair bevy of
lasses from Cardigan.&nbsp; Guilt and the punishment.</p>
<p>Next morning, Twm had the horse which he had taken from the
robber, cried through the town of Reading, in the honest hope
that he should find the rightful owner.&nbsp; He was right in his
conjecture that it would prove to be the property of some one in
that town, for a wealthy attorney claimed it, with a considerable
degree of hauteur and insolence.&nbsp; So far was this limb of
the law from either allowing our hero anything for the loss of
his own humble beast, or even thanking him for his
instrumentality in recovering a valuable horse, that he told him
he might think himself very lucky he was not prosecuted for its
being found in his possession.&nbsp; Our worthy did think himself
so, and took a precipitate departure accordingly.</p>
<p>Being now within eight-and-thirty miles of London, he resolved
to throw off his disguise, and walk the rest of the
journey.&nbsp; Accordingly, he bought a suit of clothes at
Reading, in which he concealed his money and valuables, with a
pair of pocket pistols; and thus provided he resumed his journey
to the metropolis.&nbsp; Having walked twelve miles, he attained
the town of Maidenhead.</p>
<p>On a seat outside the Bear Inn, he beheld a jovial company of
topers, and in the midst of them, Watt the mole-catcher.&nbsp; It
turned out that he had sold his <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>pigs without going to London, and
was now sauntering from tavern to tavern, squandering the money
that was not his own.&nbsp; The moment he recognized our hero, he
started on his legs, and offered him his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twm, I take shame to myself for the manner in which we
met and parted last, but I was sober then! and in my grave and
sober moods all the evil and bitterness of my heart come out; now
I am rather mellow, there&rsquo;s nothing but good in
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; On being asked when he intended to return to
Tregaron, Watt ground his teeth and
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;never!&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;it is not
from fear of old Inco Evans, for I stayed there as long as I
pleased, in spite of him, notwithstanding my promise to the
contrary.&nbsp; But for other reasons Tregaron has been made too
hot for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole of the drinking party having gradually dropped off,
Watt and our hero were left alone, when the latter with much
feeling asked his old companion what was the meaning of the
extraordinary change of manner, and of character, which he
perceived in him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell thee, lad, what&rsquo;s the
meaning&mdash;it means that instead of the frank merry fellow I
was in the dear gone days, I now am&mdash;call it what you like,
but,&rdquo;&mdash;cried Watt, laughing with wet eyes, &ldquo;some
of my dear friends who scorn flattery, would say a d&mdash;ed
rascal, and I quite agree with them.&nbsp; But never mind&mdash;I
belong to the strongest party after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero here pressed him for something of a connected account
of his adventures since he left Tregaron; on which Watt
immediately assented, and ran them over in the following off-hand
strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember, I dare say, Twm, that when you were only
a child, that I was famed throughout the village as a wit and
joker; in short, that I was the funny fellow of Tregaron, and my
ambition was to retain this title.&nbsp; The comical tricks and
humorous saying of Watt the mole-catcher, made mirth at every
farmer&rsquo;s heath, and their tables were spread with food for
me whenever I called.&nbsp; As I grew older, my pleasures <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>and
antipathies acquired a stronger cast; and there were but few in
our adjoining parishes who were subject either to execration or
ridicule, and dreaded my satire and exposure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I formed attachments more than once among the daughters
of the farmers, whom I had frequently entertained at the social
evening hearth; but although my jests were relished, my overtures
were rejected.&nbsp; In short, I found that while mirth,
innocence and harmless wit were my companions, parents generally
disposed of their daughters to young men of characters directly
opposite to mine&mdash;the stupidly grave, and thrifty, no matter
how knavish.&nbsp; My eyes were at length opened; and I found
that the funny man, however amusing as an acquaintance, was
coveted by none as a relative, but considered as a mere diverging
vagabond at best.&nbsp; Well, thought I, this will never do; but
since gravity is the order of the day, I will be as grave and
roguish as the most successful of my fellow-men.&nbsp; Having
come to this conclusion, I studied knavery, that is to say,
thrifty rascality like a science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the first step I went immediately to my grandmother,
who had often exhorted me to quit my sinful mirth and become
serious, when I assured her of my conversion, in token of which I
threw myself on my knees, and entreated her blessing.&nbsp; She
afterwards took me to a puritanic chapel, and in that assembly,
where I had often pinned the skirts and gown-tails of the elect
together, the poor old doting soul in the pride of her heart
exhibited her convert to the gaze of the saints; but neglected to
inform them that I had robbed her that same evening of half the
contents of her pocket, as she lay asleep.&nbsp; I was not long
in discovering that a sedate aspect was a goodly mask for the
most profitable villainy, and therefore determined to wear it for
life.&nbsp; Laughter, jest, and mirthful humour, and all those
thriftless indications of the light and harmless heart, I abjured
for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now gave a respite to the rats and moles, and set up
as a butcher at Tregaron; and for one sheep that <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>I bought of
the farmers, I stole three, and slaughtered them either by
moonlight on the hills, or by candle-light in my own
cottage.&nbsp; Although I daily bettered my condition, I
considered this but a slow and creeping course of thrift; and
therefore, as conscience no longer stood in my way, I meditated
some bolder way of leaping into property at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that wrinkled old she-usurer of Tregaron,
Rachel Ketch, who made money, Heaven knows how, and increased it
by lending out to country people, at a higher rate than city
usurers dared to ask.&nbsp; In the bitterness of my heart, after
losing all hope of a girl, whom I had long doated on, I went to
the old Jezabel and sought her hand in marriage; aye, and would
have taken her were she ten times as loathsome, in the anxious
hope of her speedy death, and of succeeding to her golden
hoards.&nbsp; I strove to recommend myself by assuring her I was
the most finished scoundrel in existence; and that when gain was
my object, theft, perjury, and even murder, however hideous to
silly innocents, had no power to scare me from my pursuit.&nbsp;
This avowal of my noble qualifications I thought would have won
her heart forever, but I was mistaken.&nbsp; The keen-eyed hag,
who was never seen to smile before, laughed outright at my
proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What! you want the old woman&rsquo;s gold,
master cut-throat of the muttons, do you? to slit her weasand
also, and make away with her a month after marriage, like a
troublesome old ewe;&rsquo; screamed she, as her spiteful black
and broken snags grinned defiance, and her shrill tones broke out
in laughs of mockery.&nbsp; I never saw mirth so damnable
before!&nbsp; I felt myself the butt of her ridicule, humbled and
degraded; and as my anger rose against the beldame, I resolved
that since I could not wed her, to rob her would answer my
purpose full as well.&nbsp; Accident supplied an opportunity; the
little boys who had formerly been my favourites, and who in their
innocence failed to recognize my change of character, I found it
difficult to drive from me.</p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&ldquo;A neighbour&rsquo;s child one day asked me to
lift him up to Rachel Ketch&rsquo;s thatch, to take from it a
wren&rsquo;s nest, which he had long watched, and said he was
sure that the young ones were on the eve of flying.&nbsp; It was
a winning little urchin that made the request, and I could not
refuse him.&nbsp; The moment that I raised him to a standing
position on my shoulders, he eagerly thrust his little hand into
the thatch, and cried, &lsquo;Dear, dear, how cold!&rsquo; when a
snake which he had felt, that had destroyed the young birds,
coiled itself round in the nest, darted out into his face, and
the youngster shrieked and fainted in my arms.&nbsp; I carried
him home, where he soon died of the fright, for it appeared he
was not stung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing there was a nest of these reptiles in the old
rotten straw thatch, I poked it in all directions with a long
hooked stick, and at last felt something attached to it.&nbsp; As
I drew it forward and examined it, to my great astonishment, I
found it to be an old woollen stocking, closely stuffed with
various golden coins.&nbsp; Here was a discovery!&nbsp; I felt
myself a man for ever!&nbsp; The old woman was at this time in
Carmarthenshire, where she had gone to enforce her claims to
certain debts among her former neighbours; and therefore, having
no fear of detection, I pushed back the golden prize and went
away, intending to return for it at night.&nbsp; As I anxiously
watched the hours and minutes pass away, reflecting on my
newly-acquired wealth, a raging savage spirit of avarice so
possessed me, that I determined to plunder old Rachel&rsquo;s
cottage of all the money I could find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night came, and with breathless haste I made an
entrance through the thatch, on the side furthest from the
street, and at midnight went away with a heavy booty, the greater
part of which I buried beneath the floor of my own cottage,
determined to seek an opportunity of quitting Tregaron for
ever.&nbsp; Fortune seemed to favour me beyond my hopes; Squire
Graspacre having a numerous herd of fine pigs, engaged me to
drive them to England, and sell them at a good price; I <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>have done
so, and pocketed the cash, not one farthing of which will the
squire ever handle.&nbsp; To relate all my rogueries since I
became a grave man, would take too much of your time; so here
ends my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm had heard Watt&rsquo;s tale with sorrow and regret, and
his spirits were fast sinking below zero, when a party of
Cardiganshire lasses, who were making their annual journey to
weed the gardens in the neighbourhood of London, passed opposite
the tavern door where our worthies were sitting.&nbsp; With
heart-touched delight, our hero recognized the comfortable and
not unpicturesque costume of his native country; and his
satisfaction was still increased when he found among the rural
damsels, two Tregaron girls; one of whom, named Martha Gwyn, was
a fast friend of Gwenny Cadwgan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; These poor girls
expressed their gladness to see their long-lost
&ldquo;neighbour&rsquo;s child,&rdquo; as their homely but
touching phrase went; but their recognition of Watt amounted to
such terror and abhorrence that the rose of health and innocence
faded on their cheeks, while their expanded eyes were fearfully
fixed on his countenance, as if something unearthly met their
stony stare.</p>
<p>At length they found words to say that he was charged, not
only with the robbery of Rachael Ketch&rsquo;s cottage, but with
murder; that the constables were out to search for him in all
quarters, and that Squire Graspacre had sent out a man to
supersede Watt in the care of his pigs.</p>
<p>This unexpected news, and the evident horror evinced by the
fair maidens for him, quite overcame Watt, and he showed
unmistakable signs of the fear which had taken possession of
him.&nbsp; From Martha Gwyn, Twm learned that poor Gwenny&rsquo;s
affection for him was unchanged, but it was thought, for all
that, said the candid girl, that she will be married to a
Breconshire farmer&rsquo;s son, who met her in Herefordshire,
when she went a hop-picking there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if Gwenny has him,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;it
will be for the sake of making a home for her poor
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>Twm&rsquo;s generous heart prompted him to give each
maiden a piece of silver; and, having made them eat heartily of a
good homely, substantial meal of cheese and bread and ale, he
dismissed them on their journey.&nbsp; Watt, in great agony of
mind, exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh God, where shall I fly! all my supposed security I
find but a dream, and misery alone awaits me!&nbsp; When I told
you the tale of my enormities, I kept back the relation of one
crime&mdash;a dreadful one&mdash;which, lost as I am, I felt
averse to acknowledge, and too heart-smote with the consciousness
of its atrocity, to turn to it my most secret
thought&mdash;&rsquo;twas a deed of blood, the crime of
murder!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember a tall, thin, skeleton-like man, generally
dressed in a suit of grey, who lived in a cottage on the
mountain, in the neighbourhood of Tregaron, known by the nickname
of Stalking Simon the Mooncalf, from his wandering by moon-light
over the hills.&nbsp; This man was known to be a spy, employed
and paid by all the neighbouring farmers.&nbsp; His habits were,
to sleep all day and to spend the night on the hill, watching to
identify the hedge-pluckers and sheep-stealers.&nbsp; Many poor
persons who depended on their nightly excursions for fuel, while
they deemed themselves unobserved of any human being, cutting
down a tree, or drawing dry wood from an old hedge, would
suddenly find themselves in the presence of Stalking Simon.&nbsp;
So instantaneous was his appearance, as to startle his victims
with the idea of an apparition suddenly sprung up through the
ground, as his approach was never seen till close upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis only me, neighbour,&rsquo; would be
the hypocrite&rsquo;s reply, &lsquo;searching for my stray
pony:&rsquo; but when two persons had been executed and three
transported, on his evidence, the nature of his employment became
known, and he was execrated by the whole country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moon-light night, as I was skinning a fine weather,
which I had suspended and spread out on an old storm-beaten
thorn, in a field adjoining the mountain, easy in mind, and so
fearless of danger, that I <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>whistled in a half hushed manner, as
I followed my illicit occupation, a circumstance took place that
wrought a violent change in the tone of my mind.&nbsp; My
thoughts ran on the whimsicality of the idea of selling this very
mutton to the rightful owner, on the morrow, which was
market-day, and laughing inwardly at the thought: all at once,
Stalking Simon, with a single stride, moved from behind a mossy
dwarf thorn, gray as his own suit, and stood before me.&nbsp; My
blood curdled with terror; but when the old stone-hearted wretch
made the old Judas-like reply&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is only me, searching for my pony,&rsquo; I
knew my danger, and my terror changed to savage ferocity against
the vile informer, who had ruined so many of my friends and
neighbours.&nbsp; I darted on him, grasped his collar with one
hand, and with the other stabbed him to the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watt&rsquo;s tale was now ended, and he seemed to be terribly
agitated at the recollection of old Simon&rsquo;s murder, and of
the dreadful position into which his crime had brought him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O God! what shall I do; where shall I fly?&rdquo; he
exclaimed, &ldquo;I cannot return, for that road leads straight
to the gallows, and in London I should be in hourly danger of
being seen by somebody from the country.&nbsp; Since the
perpetration of this deed of blood, I have not known an
hour&rsquo;s peace.&nbsp; Heaven is my witness, I could be
content with slavery, and smile beneath the man-driver&rsquo;s
whip&mdash;could strip myself and wander the world in nakedness,
or herd with beasts, to regain my former peace and
innocence!&nbsp; Oh, I could labour till my bones ached, and my
exhausted body dropped to the earth with fatigue, to be once more
free from the keen stings of a guilty conscience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm was but a poor comforter; for his strict ideas of justice
and retribution made him look upon Watt&rsquo;s terrible agony as
part of the punishment which he was called upon to pay for the
awful crime of murder.</p>
<p>After all, Watt&rsquo;s distress was due quite as much to the
fear of the gallows, which he now saw to be in close <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>proximity
to him, as to regret and repentance for his unwarrantable
deed.</p>
<p>Twm hardly recognized Watt as he sat there, his face blanched
with fear, large drops of sweat rolling down his pale checks,
with quivering lips and staring eyes, all showing the effect
which his knowledge of the dreadful penalty which, from every
prospect, speedily awaited him.</p>
<p>A grey-coated man now approaching the tavern, brought dreadful
associations to Watt&rsquo;s terrified conscience, and, in the
utmost trepidation, he darted out at the back door of the inn,
and ran across the fields with the speed of a pursued
murderer.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> encounters Tom
Dorbell.&nbsp; The quick encounter of their wits, in which our
hero has the advantage.&nbsp; Twm rescues a high dignitary of the
church.&nbsp; Twm&rsquo;s triumphal entry into London in a
bishop&rsquo;s carriage.</p>
<p>It was yet only four o&rsquo;clock the following morning, when
our hero was once more upon the road.&nbsp; The stars were bright
as at midnight, and the fine bracing frost, the glory of our
northern clime, seemed to have purified his blood, and at the
same time excited his fancy, so that both mind and body were
sweetly attuned, and in the full glow of enjoyment.&nbsp; It
might be thought the knowledge he had gained of Gwenny&rsquo;s
coquettings would have disheartened him; but his residence at
Ystrad Feen, with his communion with the &ldquo;lady of his
vision,&rdquo; had a little tinged his mind with something of
romantic forebodings, that overshone the rusticity of earlier
impressions.</p>
<p>Elastic and lusty were his healthy limbs, as they bounded to
the music of his heart, while he strode forward on the highway,
exulting in the thought that the day had at length arrived on
which his eyes were <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>to be regaled with a sight of the
far-famed city of London.</p>
<p>In this happy spirit, he successively passed through Langley
Broom and Colnbrook, anxiously hoping to reach Hounslow by
mid-day.&nbsp; Thus, light of heart, and full of brilliant
anticipations, he continued to bound along the road.</p>
<p>In this overweening fit of enthusiasm, he considered danger of
every sort entirely out of the question; and this, too, if he
knew the truth, while he wandered over the very hot-bed of
robbers, both foot-pads and equestrians!&nbsp; Deluded by such a
course of cogitation, he began to jeer himself on his simplicity
in keeping his pistols loaded, and considered whether he had best
fire them off for amusement or not.</p>
<p>Before he had formed his resolution, he was startled to hear a
rude and heavy tread close at his heels.&nbsp; Sudden as the
thought, he turned round, and reeled some steps backward at the
sight that presented itself!&nbsp; In the advanced light of the
morning, he beheld a villainous-looking powerful man, with a long
black-beard, who might have passed for the high-priest of a
Jewish synagogue.&nbsp; He grasped a pistol that was levelled at
his head, while his forefinger seemed actually pressing on the
trigger.&nbsp; By his ominous silence, and the fierce glare of
his eye, Twm conceived that murder and not robbery was his
object, till the ruffian roared, &ldquo;Garnish or
die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is garnish?&rdquo; stuttered Twm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money, and be d&mdash;d to you, or here goes!&rdquo;
replied the bearded man, without the slightest touch of the
dialect of the people whose chin-trimmings he had assumed.&nbsp;
Our hero saw at once that this prepared ruffian was not to be
trifled with, and that an instant&rsquo;s delay might cost him
his existence; therefore, he immediately produced from his bosom
the packet entrusted to him by Sir George Devereaux.</p>
<p>As the robber reached to snatch it, Twm&rsquo;s wits were at
work; assuming the dialect and foolery which he knew passed among
the English for Welsh, &ldquo;Here <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>wass the money, look you now, but
God tam! it wass not mine, but you shall haf it in the
tifel&rsquo;s name, only let master see I wass praave, and show
fight for it, look you, and not gif it up like a
craaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that he gave it into the
fellow&rsquo;s hand, saying, &ldquo;Now, her begs, and solicits,
and entreats you to be so kind ass to shoot some holes in hur
cott lappets, just a pounce or two, look you, to prove hur hard
fight and praavery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, with the greatest pleasure in life!&rdquo; cried
the ruffian, laughing.&nbsp; Here Twm put off his coat in an
instant, and threw it over a bush on the roadside.&nbsp; When the
robber fired at it, Twm leapt up, laughing with idiotic glee,
crying, &ldquo;Got pless hur for a praave marksman! that was a
noble pounce, look you!&nbsp; But now another pounce for tother
lappet, and I wass have great praise for praavery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the foot-pad, apparently amused, fired again, and Twm leapt
and laughed as before, exclaiming, &ldquo;That was another nople
pounce, look!&rdquo;&nbsp; He now ran to the bush, and snatching
up his coat, put it on, seemingly as delighted with its
perforations as a warrior of his vaunted scars.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,
one pounce more through my hat, look you, and all will be
right!&rdquo; added he, appealingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as to that!&rdquo; replied the robber, commencing
to break open the parcel with great eagerness, &ldquo;I have no
more pounces, as you call them, to give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have!&rdquo; thundered our hero, holding a pistol
in each hand to the robber&rsquo;s breast, &ldquo;return the
packet and garnish!&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;or I will pounce
your rascal prains apout the road, look you&mdash;and that wass
not goot for your health, look you, this fine morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robber was no bad judge of circumstances, so immediately
returned the packet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Garnish!&rdquo; roared Twm,
laughing, and holding the pistols nearer to his head; &ldquo;I
must have a new suit for the one you pounced for me, look you
now!&rdquo;&nbsp; The robber handed him a heavy purse, with a
couple of splendid watches, exclaiming &ldquo;the devil&rsquo;s
luck to you with them!&rdquo; on <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>which Twm snatched off his false
beard, as he laughingly said, &ldquo;So much for a shallow knave
whose length of beard is greater than his brains!&rdquo;&nbsp; No
sooner was the beard removed, than Twm saw a deep scar on his
left jaw, which cleared all doubt as to the identity of his
antagonist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never was Tom Dorbell so humbugged before!&rdquo; cried
the baffled ruffian, as he tore his hair up by the roots in
resentment against Fortune, that allowed such an inauspicious day
to dawn on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; Tom Dorbell, the Gallant Glover?&rdquo;
queried Twm, with amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;The same,&rdquo;
growled the knight of the road, &ldquo;till my luck turned; but
now I am nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that blushing witness on your jaw-bone, I perceive
we once met before,&rdquo; quoth Twm, jeeringly; &ldquo;I think,
on the other side of Reading.&nbsp; I think, too, that, in token
of friendship, we exchanged horses on that occasion, a Welsh pony
for a gallant grey; and, I think, also, but perhaps I am
mistaken, that I threw thee a long purse full of something
<i>that uncle Timothy gave I to market for him at
Reading</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the well mimicked simplicity of the latter words, the
freebooter knew him at once, and laughing in his turn, vowing
that he was now satisfied that he was outdone by no common
&rsquo;un, &ldquo;but a d&mdash;ned clever fellow, whoever thee
bee&rsquo;st&rdquo;&nbsp; Quick as the fox who hears the hounds
and hunters long before the sound can reach indifferent ears, Tom
Dorbell started&mdash;gave a hasty farewell, dashed through the
hedge, over a field, and was soon out of sight.</p>
<p>The Gallant Glover&rsquo;s well-trained ears had heard the
sound of horses&rsquo; feet, and, taking all things into
consideration, he had thought it best to decline any fresh
interview with travelling humanity until he had recovered his
serenity of mind, and was in a position to enforce any demands it
might please him to make.</p>
<p>As the approaching horse and rider neared him, Twm perceived
the latter to be a wounded man, evidently so much disabled as to
be scarcely capable <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>of sitting on his horse.&nbsp; With
courteous but hurried accents, the stranger addressed our hero,
lifting his hat as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pardon, sir; if you are armed and inclined to act
a brave and generous part, you have now an opportunity of doing
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm declared his readiness.&nbsp; The stranger
dismounted, with pain; &ldquo;Take this horse,&rdquo; cried he,
&ldquo;ride forward as fast as you can, and a quarter of a mile
on you will find a couple of robbers rifling a coach.&nbsp; Other
assistance may arrive&mdash;on! on, sir! in heaven&rsquo;s name!
the party assaulted are of no common rank or
estimation&mdash;profit and reputation will attend their
liberator, and&rdquo;&mdash;Twm was out of hearing before he
could finish his sentence.</p>
<p>Never did a young medical practitioner, called on an emergency
to the bedside of a wealthy patient, whom he never thought to
have the honour to approach, ride forth with a more excited
imagination.&nbsp; Fire flashed from the stones, ground to powder
by his horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and brief was the gallop that brought
him in sight of the scene of villainy.</p>
<p>The first object that struck his view were three or four
horses, with their harness cut, one dead, and the others
struggling on the road-side, while the centre was occupied by an
un-horsed coach.&nbsp; As he came nearer, he distinctly made out
a man at each door of the vehicle, their feet resting on the
steps, while their heads, and the greater portion of their
bodies, were invisible, implying their activity in the work of
depredation.&nbsp; So intently devoted were they to this grand
undertaking, that Twm&rsquo;s approach seemed either unnoticed or
mistaken, perhaps, for the wounded and unharmed
gentleman&rsquo;s, who had apprised him of this nefarious
business.&nbsp; With that happy forethought given by indulgent
Providence to the self-dependent, and which forms one of the
grand ingredients in the chalice of success, our hero turned his
horse from the thundering road to the soundless green beside it,
and silently gained upon his object.</p>
<p>He arrived within twenty paces of the coach, when <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>the green
altogether ceased.&nbsp; Dismounting with the alacrity of the
occasion, silent as the mole, and swift as the greyhound, he made
a rush forward, and, contrary to his expectation, he found
himself, unchallenged or unnoticed, close to the coach.&nbsp; He
heard one of the amiable threatening instant death to his
&ldquo;Lordship&rsquo;s reverence&rdquo; unless his watch
accompanied his purse into the hands of his
&ldquo;solicitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opposite worthy was equally polite to a lady, after his
own fashion, declaring that he had shot one of her sex lately for
less provocation than she had shown, in withholding his fair
demands, which was merely all her cash and jewels.</p>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s instantaneous action was to catch the nearest
gentleman by the ankles.&nbsp; With a powerful drag backwards,
his feet were jerked off the coach-steps, and his full face
literally <i>scraped</i> an ungentle acquaintance with their iron
edges, in its rapid descent to the frosty road, which was flooded
with his blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollo! where are you, Bill?&rdquo; enquired his active
partner, thinking that he had merely lost his footing and falling
accidentally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried Twm, firing at the word, when the
robber fell backward from his perch, a lifeless corpse.&nbsp;
Before he could recover himself, our hero was grappled at the
throat by the powerful hands of the first robber.&nbsp; In the
struggle, Twm managed to strike him twice with his discharged
pistol on his blood-covered face; but the strong ruffian&rsquo;s
tenacious grip tightened notwithstanding; and our tale must have
terminated here, with the death of its hero, but for an
unexpected relief.</p>
<p>The venerable and aged gentleman in the coach with his
daughter, looking out on this deadly struggle with intense
anxiety, snatched up a pistol which had been dropped in the
carriage, seized a critical moment, and discharged it at the ear
of the freebooter, whose head was perforated by the bullet, so
that his grasp relaxed, and he fell backward, with his eyes
glaring on his <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>intended victim, and, with a ferocious oath in his
mouth, he expired.</p>
<p>The aged gentleman now called to the lady, who sprang from the
coach, declaring he feared that the villain had succeeded in
destroying their deliverer.&nbsp; Well, indeed, might he have
thought so, as Twm had sunk senseless on the road, the stagnant
blood blackening in his face, and his eyes projecting from their
sockets.</p>
<p>On recovering a little, he found a young lady bathing his
temples, and applying her scent-bottle, while the venerable old
gentleman was busied in rubbing his neck to restore the
circulation of the blood, which now happily took place.</p>
<p>On his recovery, our hero learnt that the party whom he had
succoured were the venerable Doctor Morgan, Bishop of St. Asaph,
translator of the Scriptures into Welsh, and his only daughter;
and that the wounded gentleman who sent Twm to their rescue, and
who had now rejoined the party, was his lordship&rsquo;s
chaplain.</p>
<p>This spirited clergyman had manfully opposed the depredators,
when they first attacked the coach, but was sadly wounded by a
bullet in the right arm.&nbsp; In the midst of the
congratulations, compliments, and explanations that followed, the
spirit of the scene became suddenly changed to one that is
patronized by the comic muse.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the report of the bishop&rsquo;s servants, who
liberated themselves, having been tied to a tree by the thieves,
the town of Hounslow evinced its heroism by sending forth its
constabulary force, with the principal inn-keeper, who was also a
farmer, and his farm-servants.</p>
<p>A motley assemblage, in truth, it proved!&nbsp; Some were on
foot, and some on horse or ass-back, and one fellow was seen
bestriding a large horned ox, that reluctantly yielded the speed
required of him; while each and all were as whimsically armed as
mounted.&nbsp; The valiant joskin on the ox, flourished a flail,
threatening annihilation to the rogues of the road, but
lucklessly <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>struck his own sconce by exercising the weapon.&nbsp;
The ostler and waiter, who was also the plough-boy, was mounted
on a superannuated blind mare, and grasped a dung-fork with the
consequence of a Neptune&rsquo;s trident.&nbsp; Among the others
were seen bill-hooks, a scythe, three spades, an awfully long
spit, and a ponderous wooden beetle.</p>
<p>But the most amusing figure in the group was the old landlady
and farm-wife, who had hastily mounted a donkey, and was riding
it in a more masculine style than is usual to the fair sex, and
thumping the restive brute with a vast wooden ladle, with which,
for she led the van, she was prepared to battle with the
highwaymen.&nbsp; Finding them already conquered, her heroic
spirit vented itself in discontent, that she had had no hand in
the great event.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang un!&rdquo; quoth the doughty dame, &ldquo;I would
ha baisted the chops o&rsquo;un noicely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame on thee, dame! cover thy garters&mdash;whoy
dusten roide like a christen woman,&rdquo; cried her lord and
master, who rode a high horse, and bore a huge cavalry sword.</p>
<p>At this rebuke, the bishop&rsquo;s daughter, his lordship, and
the chaplain, laughed most heartily; while our hero, now pretty
well recovered, joined in their glee.</p>
<p>The fallen being consigned to the care of the landlord, and
the coach somewhat righted, our hero was seated by the chaplain,
and facing his lordship, who, with his amiable daughter,
cordially acknowledged his services; which the worthy prelate
declared were not to be requited with mere words.</p>
<p>Twm, with truth, averred he was indebted for his life to the
promptitude with which his lordship brought the ruffian down; and
therefore the services he received, he said, far over-balanced
any that he had rendered.&nbsp; The modest position in which he
had thus placed himself, worked well in his favour, and was fully
estimated.&nbsp; After having refreshed at Hounslow, and the
chaplain&rsquo;s arm dressed, depositions having been made,
before the judicial authorities, of the attack and rescue, the
party <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>filled his lordship&rsquo;s carnage again, and all were
driven off towards London, well guarded by a rustic patrol sent
from Hounslow.</p>
<p>On the way, Twm explained that he was an agent of Sir George
Devereaux&rsquo;s to a Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s in Holborn, and the
bearer of a sum of money to him.&nbsp; The bishop seemed
surprised, and declared that Mr. Martyn was his very good friend,
and chosen by him to be an umpire on the following day, in a
matter of great importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, then,&rdquo; added the bishop, &ldquo;I
shall see you at my friend&rsquo;s house, and learn from you in
what manner I can serve your interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lordship will have your long deferred explanation
with the fiery old baronet, Sir John Wynn, then,
to-morrow?&rdquo; asked the chaplain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the old bishop, &ldquo;and heaven
send me scatheless from a contest with that self-willed
man!&nbsp; In our interview I can only repeat what I have
objected in my letters; and right well I know, he can only
reiterate his former ill-grounded assertions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero was thunderstruck with these observations and became
silent and thoughtful.</p>
<p>Many were the villages and suburbs through which they passed,
before the lady, breaking a silence which had endured some time,
exclaimed, &ldquo;The stones of London, at last, my
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The worthy prelate directed his coachman to drive to Mr.
Martyn&rsquo;s; and, in a brief space, the carriage stopped at a
large, lofty, and many gabled house, opposite to St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Church, in Holborn, where Twm was put down, and
kindly received by Mr. Martyn, who helped him from the
bishop&rsquo;s coach.&nbsp; His lordship observed that he was
waited for by his brother, the Bishop of London, at Lambeth
Palace; briefly referred to the business of the morrow, kindly
shook hands with our hero, as did the young lady and the
chaplain, each repeating their acknowledgments, and when the <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>carriage
drove off, Twm Shon Catty was ceremoniously ushered into the fine
town-house of Mr. Martyn.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span>, at last, face
to face with his paternal parent.&nbsp; A little scene between a
Baronet and a Bishop.&nbsp; Twm&rsquo;s particular star
brightens.</p>
<p>When it became known that Twm was the bearer of money from the
baronet to Mr. Martyn, that he had rescued the bishop of St.
Asaph and party, and that he was the hero of many other
encounters with daring highwaymen, he became quite a lion in the
house, was regarded as a fine specimen of a Welshman, and, in
homely language, was &ldquo;made much of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Previous to the sound slumber that soon overcame his
softly-pillow&rsquo;d head, he pondered much on what he had heard
of his reputed father, and felt his mind strongly impressed with
the idea that the coming morrow teemed with events that would
cast their shade or sunshine on his future days.</p>
<p>In a dream that followed, he found himself in the presence of
a passionate little gentleman who threatened him with terrible
vengeance, unless he returned to the house of Morris Greeg, and
gave his hand in marriage to the amiable daughter Shaan; and he
thought he discovered in a murky recess, a parrot-nosed sprite,
resembling Moses, who was grinning at his dilemma; when the lady
of his former dream appeared suddenly, and smiled like an angel
on the churlish old man, who forthwith smiled again, when Ianto
Gwyn stood forth with his harp; on which he joined her in a Welsh
jig.&nbsp; Then came a long and dreamless sleep, which at length
was broken by the numerous clocks of London, clamorously
informing its citizens of the seventh hour of a new day.</p>
<p><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>The
letters borne by our hero to Mr. Martyn from Sir George Devereaux
spoke most highly of his abilities and good qualities; and the
trust reposed in him by the baronet was fully evinced by his
being trusted with such an important pecuniary mission as that
which had brought him to London.</p>
<p>In addition, his introduction by the Bishop of St. Asaph, with
the details of his acknowledged services to that venerable
prelate, insured our hero the most marked consideration among his
present friends, who vied with each other in their attentions to
him.&nbsp; The whole family expressed their hope that his stay
would be long in town; and Mrs. Martyn insisted that he would
make their house his home the while.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Twm requested a private conversation with his
host; when he explained, with straightforward candour, that,
although unlooked-for circumstances had placed him in his present
favourable position, he was, in reality, the most friendless of
human beings; inasmuch that he was a natural son, unacknowledged
by his father.</p>
<p>Mr. Martyn kindly commiserated him; and our hero
continued,&mdash;&ldquo;I learnt yesterday evening that the
Bishop of St. Asaph is to-day engaged to meet the man, who, of
all others, I wish, yet dread to see&mdash;my father, Sir John
Wynn of Gwydir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir John Wynn, your father!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
Martyn, in great astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;The same,&rdquo;
replied Twm, &ldquo;yet he knows me not, nor have I a single
document or a witness to prove it.&nbsp; Yet did I hope, ardently
hope, that some chance would turn up in my favour, to avail
myself of the meeting of this day, between Sir John and the good
bishop.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Martyn said, with much concern, that,
although their mutual friend, he saw great difficulties to oppose
the introduction of such a matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This conference,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;cannot end
amicably; one party is bent on urging a claim, while the other is
resolved to reject it, and they will part bad friends at last;
while I, their umpire, cannot prevent <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>it.&nbsp; Sir John, ruffled by
disappointment, will be in no cue to listen to any claims on his
kindness, especially one of a nature so serious, more especially
as the very existence of such a complaint, criminates his past
conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck our hero, that it would be well to make the
benevolent bishop acquainted with his tale, and take his advice;
with which suggestion, Mr. Martyn entirely agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bishop,&rdquo; observed the latter, &ldquo;is an
early man, generally, and will, no doubt, be the first to call
this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; While they were yet speaking, a
servant announced Sir John Wynn&rsquo;s carriage; and before Mr.
Martyn could reply, or rise from his chair, Sir John Wynn
entered.&nbsp; Martyn, rising with a bland countenance, met the
Baronet&rsquo;s advances with courtesy, if not cordiality.&nbsp;
Our hero having retired to the window, was unseen by Sir John,
although Twm seized the opportunity of exercising all his powers
of observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am the first in the field, I see,&rdquo;
observed the Baronet; &ldquo;and now, my dear Mr. Martyn, let me
again impress you with the sense of the wrongs I endured from
this ungrateful Priest, this Bishop of my own
making.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear Sir John,&rdquo; replied
Martyn, &ldquo;he may arrive this instant, and then see how
unseemly it will be to find you touching on the case before his
arrival, and me your unbiassed umpire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Martyn, Martyn!&rdquo; replied the Baronet,
disregarding the delicacy of the appeal, &ldquo;there is no grief
like the grief of unkindness; he rewarded me with evil for good,
to the great discomfort of my soul.&nbsp; I may well say so, and
justly complain to you of my Lord of St. Asaph, who, besides what
his ancestors received of mine, is in many matters beholden to
me.&nbsp; My mind is eased by opening to you his hard dealings
with me, and my benefits towards him;&mdash;but who is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero, feeling the awkwardness of his situation, had
coughed gently, to inform the gentleman of his presence, and
while making towards the door, was not <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>ungracefully apologizing for his presence.&nbsp; He
stopped as Mr. Martyn took his hand, and replied, &ldquo;A young
countryman of yours, Sir John; or, I should say, a South Walian,
whom I beg leave to introduce to you as my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; cried Sir John, with his constitutional
heartiness, &ldquo;a young Welshman, a countryman of my own; your
hand, Sir!&rdquo; and the old gentleman shook it with a friendly
feeling towards his country, if not the individual.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I could have sworn,&rdquo; continued Sir John, &ldquo;he
was a native of our glorious mountain land, by his frank open
countenance, and healthy look, unlike your suet-pudding-faced
cockneys here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A servant answering the bell, Mr. Martyn desired that his son
should show his guest to the picture gallery, on which our hero
withdrew, with a tear in his eye which he found it impossible to
suppress, when he felt the pressure of his father&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>The parlour door being closed, Martyn recounted briefly our
hero&rsquo;s adventures, in bringing him a considerable sum of
money, from Carmarthenshire.&nbsp; Sir John gave one of his most
loud and hearty laughs, when he heard how he outwitted the
notorious Tom Dorbell.&nbsp; But when he related his part in the
rescue of the Bishop, at the imminent peril of his life, the
Baronet grew serious; but giving way to his spleen against the
prelate, he replied, &ldquo;I wish he had saved some one more
worthy of his bravery!&mdash;but, Martyn, I must be better
acquainted with this gallant.&nbsp; A brave young Welshman like
this, should be known, noted, and patronized! but perhaps he has
abundance of friends without my thought of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, Sir John, he is a stranger in London, and
almost friendless anywhere,&mdash;he is a natural son; but you
may hear his history hereafter,&rdquo; replied Mr. Martyn, almost
pointedly, as he fixed his eyes on the Baronet.</p>
<p>This was not unobserved by him, as he smiled, and said,
&ldquo;You mean something, Martyn; but let it pass <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>for the
present; so let us proceed with this matter of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In honour and truth, I can hear no more till his
lordship arrives,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why doesn&rsquo;t he come, then,&rdquo; said Sir
John, with the unamiable frown that at times distinguished him;
adding, rather superciliously, &ldquo;is it fitting Mr. Martyn,
that the head of the house of Gwydir should be waiting the
leisure of this parson lord,&mdash;I shall drive out a little,
and let him wait for me in his turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John took a quick turn towards the door, but, stopping
suddenly, said he would join the young men in the picture
gallery, where, accompanied by Mr. Martyn, he went.&nbsp; With
the younger Martyn, the Baronet was well enough acquainted; and
now his aim was to chat with our hero.</p>
<p>Twm became a little agitated as he found himself in close
contact with his father, and a something like an equality in
society, since they were both friends in the same family.&nbsp;
True, this was really owing to the accident of circumstances, but
Twm was there fairly upon his own merits, and not by
imposition.&nbsp; Sir John asked him particulars concerning his
adventures on the highway, and Twm, throwing all his natural wit
into the account, made a favourable impression on his father.</p>
<p>The Martyns, father and son, being summoned down stairs, the
stately baronet was left alone with his humble and unknown
son.&nbsp; Twm looked towards the walls, with some feelings of
awkwardness.&nbsp; The old-fashioned gallery was hung with
numerous paintings: portraits by Holbein and Vandyke, with
interesting and humorous pieces by foreign masters.&nbsp; Sir
John pointed out and warmly expatiated on the merits and
peculiarities of the various schools, fixing his eyes more on our
hero&rsquo;s face than on the paintings, to measure the extent of
his taste and intellect by the effect they might produce on him;
for the Baronet was quite an enthusiast in the fine arts, and
would be quick in discovering whether or not he <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>was
throwing away his observations on a blockhead.&nbsp; He was not
slow in observing the evidence of mind in his auditor, from the
deep interest which he took in his details; but he especially
remarked that his fancy was principally taken by the drolleries
and homeliness of the Dutch and Flemish pictures, in one of which
Twm fancied he saw a resemblance to Carmarthen Jack, his aunt
Juggy, of hump-backed peculiarity, and even a counterpart to the
starveling Moses.&nbsp; Apologizing for the rusticity of his
taste, he owned his admiration of the boors and the lowly
damsels, as they reminded him of some such, the familiars of his
childhood in Wales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where might that be passed?&rdquo; enquired the
Baronet, smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the humble town of Tregaron, in
Cardiganshire,&rdquo; replied Twm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the principal gentry in that
neighbourhood?&rdquo; enquired the Baronet.&nbsp; When Twm
mentioned Squire Graspacre and his late lady, Sir John looked him
hard in the face; then, silently fixing his eyes on the floor, he
recollected a certain passage in his life, that prevented him
visiting Graspacre-Hall, from the dread he entertained of the
censures and lectures of his decorous and straight-laced sister,
Mrs. Graspacre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know the lady you mentioned, Mrs.
Graspacre?&rdquo; enquired the baronet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well,
Sir John,&rdquo; was Twm&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;I have great
reason, for, to that lady&rsquo;s benevolence I am indebted for
the little education I have received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Sir John knew very well that his sister was anything but
benevolent, so that by this assertion our hero lost a little in
his opinion, and he suspected him of a little cant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she sent you to school, she had some motive; what
was it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a natural son, Sir John, which,
perhaps Mr. Martyn informed you of: the lady sent me to school,
because one of her great relations was said to be my
father,&rdquo; replied Twm, fixing his eyes on the <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>baronet&rsquo;s face, which he had the satisfaction of
seeing quail beneath his riveting gaze.</p>
<p>Recovering himself, however, he cast a severe look on our
hero, and, in a harsh tone and manner, said, &ldquo;Now must I
doubt all your assertions, as one falsehood is apparent to
me.&nbsp; The lady you named was my sister, and certain it is
that no relation of hers could be your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the lion in our hero&rsquo;s heart was roused, and he
indignantly repelled the charge of falsehood, saying that he
expected neither truth nor honour from his father, since he was
known to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may be your father&rsquo;s name then?&rdquo;
asked the Baronet, biting his lip, to prevent the laughter that
seemed ready to burst out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir John Wynn of
Gwydir!&rdquo; exclaimed Twm in a dare-devil strain, that made
the Baronet start at his vehemence.&nbsp; Admiring the fire that
flashed in his eyes, his honest, fearless, and energetic
behaviour, Sir John opened his arms, and received him in his
embrace!</p>
<p>When Mr. Martyn came to announce the arrival of the bishop, he
found our hero sobbing on his father&rsquo;s neck, who soothed
him by promises, that the neglect of years should now be
remedied, and that he was glad and proud of the original, which
he found in Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s picture gallery.</p>
<p>The interview had ended very differently to what Twm and Mr.
Martyn had expected, and our hero felt grateful to a protecting
Providence which had so ordered events.</p>
<p>Sir John and Mr. Martyn descended, and our hero was left alone
in the picture gallery.&nbsp; They joined the worthy Bishop at
the table in the old-fashioned saloon, which, being overlooked
from the rails of the gallery, Twm saw and heard all that passed,
by the particular invitation of his worthy host.</p>
<p>The Bishop commenced addressing Mr. Martyn:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are here met to-day, Mr. Martyn,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to submit to your arbitration, a matter in dispute between
Sir John and myself.&nbsp; Sir John has expressed <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>himself to
you with reference to me, in an unfriendly manner, yet I have
every confidence in your impartial judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
Mr. Martyn bowed, and Sir John, coughing to keep down his choler,
of which he had as good a share as ever fell to the lot of a
Cambro Briton, flourished his laced cambric handkerchief about
his face, as he added, &ldquo;His lordship cannot be more glad of
an unbiassed umpire than I am myself, Mr. Martyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop continued:&mdash;&ldquo;Sir John&rsquo;s request to
me, was, that I would confirm a lease for three lives, upon the
rectory of Llanrwst, at the yearly rent of fifty pounds; the same
being worth one hundred and forty pounds, and is of my
patronage.&nbsp; This request much perplexed my mind, for it
grieved me to deny Sir John anything, yet my conscience cried
aloud against such a grant, so prejudicial to the church itself,
and especially to the next incumbent, whom I should have
grievously wronged by beggaring the See, and injuring the living
for future Clergymen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the Bishop resumed his seat, and the Baronet with great
assumption of stateliness, rose and spoke in a slow and
acrimonious strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sower went out to sow; and some of his seed fell in
stony ground, where it withered, because it took not root; the
seed was good, but the land nought.&nbsp; I may justly say so by
you, my lord.&nbsp; I have in all things showed myself a friend,
my lord; inasmuch that if I had not pointed the way with my
finger, whereof I have yet good testimony, your lordship would
have been still humble vicar of Llaurhaiader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop, without rising, mildly replied, &ldquo;You have
done me much kindness, Sir John, but no dishonest kindness; nor
do I mean to deny you any of your fair requests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really much obliged to your lordship, for your
present good opinion,&rdquo; replied the Baronet, with sneering
courtesy, &ldquo;more particularly that you express your opinion
before Mr. Martyn.&nbsp; But the words you <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>have just
uttered agree only indifferently with others you have at various
times used in reference to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Sir John,&rdquo; replied the Bishop, &ldquo;you do
wrong me very much to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John replied with much warmth, &ldquo;I have good proof,
my lord, that you protested to your late servant, Thomas Vaughan,
that all the good I ever did you, when vicar of Llaurhaiader, was
to go to Llandda Church, and with my family add so much to your
scanty congregation there; and, forsooth! that I had once on a
time sent you a fat ox, on your installation in the See of Asaph;
truly, my lord, this is to strain at a gnat, and swallow a
camel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good Bishop&rsquo;s reply was mild and conciliating.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good Sir John, you wrong yourself as much as me, to
believe such idle sayings.&nbsp; If this were not a case of
conscience, you should not need to ask me twice; remembering
ancient kindness, your request is of great force to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You plead conscience when you should give, and make no
pains to receive courtesy of your friends,&rdquo; replied Sir
John.&nbsp; Then, changing from the sarcastic tone in which this
was uttered to one of vehemence, he proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
appeal to Him who searches the consciences of all men, whether
you have used me well; and whether conscience, which you have
ever in your mouth, be the sole hindrance of my request.&nbsp; I
will avow and justify it before the greatest divines in England,
that has always been the usage, now is, and ever will be, that a
man may with a safe conscience be a farmer of a living, paying in
effect for the same as much as it is worth.&nbsp; I stand on your
word, my lord of St. Asaph, your sacred word of promise, the
confirmation of my lease and the advowson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Temperate and patient still was the Prelate&rsquo;s
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I made no such promise; my words were
&lsquo;that I would be very loath to confirm any lease upon any
presentative benefice; that I would do as much, and more for you,
than for any other; that if I would confirm any <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>lease,
yours would be the first.&rsquo;&nbsp; In conclusion, I never did
confirm any, nor do I mean so to do; therefore is such
conditional promise void, and my honour and word sufficiently
vindicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baronet tenaciously urged,&mdash;&ldquo;It is well known
that your Lordship has favoured others in such a
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; replied the Bishop, rather more
impatiently; &ldquo;you well know there is a difference between
granting a lease of our own, and confirming the lease of another;
between a presentative benefice and an impropriation; between a
public usage and a private one: still you refuse to note these
distinctions, and exclaim that I have confirmed the lease, and
will not, according to my promise, confirm yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last remark of the Bishop&rsquo;s appeared to be
unanswerable, and Sir John seemed to think so too, as, instead of
replying to the argument directly, he began to beg the question,
and give way to the overbearing petulance of a spoiled child of
fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;the loss of the
thing that I regard a dobkin, but your unkind dealing; it shall
lessen me hereafter to expect no sweet fruit from so sour a
stock.&nbsp; But my lord of St. Asaph, you know my stand in the
world.&nbsp; I never have been a man to make requests and be
denied; therefore having never failed before in my requests, my
grief is the greater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray Heaven, Sir John, that your grief of missing be
not like Ahab&rsquo;s grief for Naboth&rsquo;s vineyard,&rdquo;
was the Bishop&rsquo;s pithy and characteristic reply.</p>
<p>Here Sir John sprang to his feet, exclaiming almost fiercely,
&ldquo;My lord, my lord, I am not of a nature to put up with
wrongs; for as I have studied for your good, and wrought the
same, so be assured of me as bitter an enemy as ever I was a
steadfast friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fiery little father have I found to-day,&rdquo;
thought Twm, as he noticed the vehemence of the baronet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed of you,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;almost
forgetting the courtesy of a gentleman, and the firm, <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>but mild
and patriachal character of the Bishop.&nbsp; I am ashamed for
you, that you have hereby given cause to your enemies and mine to
descant on the ingrate disposition.&nbsp; You have made use of
gentlemen when they serve you, and afterwards discard them, on
the pretence of conscience, forsooth!&nbsp; I laboured in your
cause, my lord, as if it had been to save the life of one of my
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These hard uncompromising words did not exasperate the
venerable prelate, whose command of temper under trying
circumstances, and unjust aspersions, was worthy of his
reputation.&nbsp; He rose with dignified demeanour, and said,
&ldquo;Amongst other kindnesses, Sir John you gave good testimony
of me; I pray you let me continue worthy of it; so many chips
have been already hewed from the church, that it is ready to
fall; you ought rather to help than to despoil it.&nbsp; Thus it
stands with us, Sir John, which I pray you Mr. Martyn note.&nbsp;
You ask of me certain leases&mdash;you ask me to injure my
successor in my diocese, to benefit you! you urge the favours I
have received at your hands, and claim from me rewards that are
not mine to give.&nbsp; Were I to grant your desires I should
prove myself a dishonest, unconscionable, irreligious man, a
sacrilegious robber of the church, a perfidious spoiler of my
diocese, and an unnatural foe to preachers and scholars.&nbsp; I
do verily think it were better to rob on the highway than to do
the thing you request.&nbsp; However hard you may take my denial,
be it known to you, if the father and mother whom I loved and
honoured were alive and made such requests, I should have the
grace to say nay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop took his seat, and began to repeat his regrets,
when the Baronet started from the table, and in a furious mood
began to pace the saloon to and fro; but stopping suddenly he
exclaimed, &ldquo;Your verbal love I esteem as nothing!&nbsp; I
have ten sons&mdash;(eleven interrupted the Bishop, with quite
jocoseness;) I say I have ten sons,&rdquo; repeated the Baronet;
and &ldquo;if <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>ever they forget this,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Eleven sons
and the last as good as the best;&rdquo; interrupted the Bishop
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;But where is this gallant
deliverer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Martyn beckoned our hero down, while Sir John suddenly
resumed his seat at the table.&nbsp; On the good Prelate&rsquo;s
pressing Twm to name in what manner he could reward his services,
he at last replied, &ldquo;By yielding to Sir John&rsquo;s
request as far as your Lordship sees right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole party stared with amazement at the unexpected
reply.&nbsp; The Baronet was softened to tears, and but for
compromising his dignity, would have embraced him before them
all.&nbsp; The Bishop smiled, and shaking his hand very cordially
replied, &ldquo;The request is as graceful in you to make as in
me, to deny; that question is disposed of.&nbsp; In a few days I
will call again, when you may decide in what I can be of service
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then took a courteous leave of Mr. Martyn and of our hero,
with a ceremonious bow to Sir John, and departed.&nbsp; Right
glad was Martyn to be relieved, by the temper of the Baronet,
from the unpleasant office of an arbitrator of their
differences.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> meets one of
his best friends from Wales.&nbsp; Death of Sir George
Devereaux.&nbsp; Hopes and fears.&nbsp; Interruption of happy
hours.&nbsp; Lady Devereaux&rsquo;s forced return to Wales.&nbsp;
Twm follows her.</p>
<p>Our hero was now living amongst the <i>elite</i> of the
metropolis, and his daily communion with men of taste, feeling,
and education, produced a quick and remarkable change for the
better in his manners and personal appearance.&nbsp; His
new-found father assisted him largely in his finances, and a
handsome pecuniary present from the worthy bishop, accompanied
with a <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>complimentary letter, which was doubly gratifying to
him, as emanating from so respectable a source.</p>
<p>When he had been eight months in London, he was sitting alone
one morning in Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s picture gallery, intently
pondering on his future plans of life, considering whether to
return to his friends at Ystrad Feen, or seek employment in
town.&nbsp; His reverie was disturbed by a servant&rsquo;s
informing him that a gentleman was waiting to see him.</p>
<p>On his descent to the parlour, great and gratifying was his
surprise to meet there his old friend Rhys.&nbsp; The cordiality
of their mutual greetings but faintly echoed the ardour of their
feelings.&nbsp; News from the country was our hero&rsquo;s first
inquiry, and Rhys assured him he had an abundance to
relate.&nbsp; Gwenny Cadwgan is married, and living with her
husband and father on a fine farm at Kevencoer-Cummer, near
Merthyr.&nbsp; Walt the mole-catcher is transported, having
narrowly escaped the gallows.&nbsp; Your mother and step-father
are well.&nbsp; &ldquo;So much for Tregaron news,&rdquo; said
Rhys; &ldquo;and now for Ystrad Feen and Llandovery.&nbsp; A
singular coincidence,&mdash;in the same week we lost the
venerable Vicar Prichard, and your friend Sir George
Devereaux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last is a climax indeed to your budget; but is it
really a fact that Sir George is no more?&rdquo; enquired Twm,
looking hard in his friend&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact as deeth! as the Scotchman says,&rdquo; replied
Rhys; &ldquo;He threw his life away in one of his foolish
fox-hunting leaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&nbsp; I am truly sorry,&rdquo; exclaimed
Twm, &ldquo;for he was a kind being.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
so; but tell me truly,&rdquo; said Rhys, looking archly in his
friend&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;is it for death, or his lady&rsquo;s
being left so young a widow, that your sorrow is most
intense?&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm looked grave, but finally smiled, as
Rhys, with great archness, added, &ldquo;It somewhat strikes me
that this is a sorrow which you will soon get over; and, if I
mistake not, so will the widow too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Twm took his hand, and said, &ldquo;You look deeper into
the hearts of men than I thought; but listen to a <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>mystery and
expound the dream that has so long haunted me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he related the particulars of the &ldquo;glorious
vision&rdquo; in the hay-loft of Morris Greeg, and of its
repetition since he came to London; &ldquo;and strange to
say,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;it was in widow&rsquo;s weeds the
fair spirit each time appeared.&nbsp; What can be the meaning or
end of such dreams?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
thee,&rdquo; answered Rhys, leaning on his shoulder and looking
in his face; &ldquo;Dreams long nursed, especially waking dreams,
in time become realities&mdash;so will yours; you will marry this
young widow, Twm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me! impossible!&rdquo; cried Twm, blushing from the
chin to the forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, very well, I&rsquo;ll
court her myself, then!&rdquo; cried Rhys; on which they both
burst into a most hearty laugh.</p>
<p>Our hero was growing silent and meditative, when Rhys,
striking him a hearty smack on the shoulder, asked, &ldquo;What
would you say now, if the fair widow was herself in town at this
moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Twm, starting up, with an expression
of interest that nothing could repress.&nbsp; Rhys in a most
serious strain, assured him that her father, being chosen a
knight of the shire for the ancient county of Brecon, was now in
town with his widowed daughter.&nbsp; That he had ridden to town
in their company, by which he had availed himself of a safe
escort from the dangers of the road.&nbsp; Rhys added, that he
had frequently conversed with the Lady Devereaux, both at home
and on the journey, and that he, Master Thomas Jones, had always
been the subject of her conversation and eulogy.</p>
<p>Very shortly after this conversation, in fact as shortly after
as sufficed to take Twm and his friend Rhys to the town-house of
Sir John Price, which was situated in Derby-street, Westminster,
our hero was shaking hands and exchanging hearty good-wishes and
congratulations with the &ldquo;lady of his dream.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His recollection of his dearly-cherished vision was now <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>stronger
than ever, in consequence of the widows&rsquo; cap which she had
lately assumed.</p>
<p>On the part of Sir John, our hero&rsquo;s reception was more
ceremonious than friendly, but the feeling evinced in his
daughter&rsquo;s eyes, and the speaking pressure of her hand,
made ample amends for the baronet&rsquo;s stately coldness.</p>
<p>Having dined together, Sir John retired early on a more
ceremonial visit, and the three friends were left together; for
Lady Devereaux held Rhys in great esteem for his high
professional character, and unassuming manners; and, in truth, we
must add, more than all, for the friendship evinced by him for
our hero, and the friendly way in which he spoke of him in his
absence.&nbsp; It was with surprise and regret they heard the
announcement of Rhys&rsquo; intention (being now superceded in
his curacy by the new incumbent,) of quitting his country and
entering a foreign university, to seek in a far land that
consideration and advancement not attainable in his own.</p>
<p>Lady Devereaux being only in the fifth month of her widowhood,
the conversation, although kindly in the extreme, was of a
melancholy cast.&nbsp; Rhys having to embark in the morning,
urged the necessity of retiring early, and took his final leave
of the fair widow, who expressed the kindest wishes for his
prosperity and success in all undertakings.</p>
<p>Accompanying his friend, Twm bade her adieu for the evening,
and gained her leave to repeat his visit on the morrow.&nbsp; The
permission to repeat his visits was eagerly seized by Twm, and
not once a day only, but many times did he trouble Sir
John&rsquo;s stately domestic to open the door to him.&nbsp; That
he was welcome by the fair enchantress, he could not doubt, and
pleasant were the mid-day walks in the Park or Mall, their indoor
conferences, and the evening parties at which they shone as
twin-stars; but trebly pleasant to our hero was the hour in which
he ventured to break to her his tender feelings and his darling
hopes.</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>With
the utmost candour, and without the least reservation, he told
the humbleness of his origin, the blemish in his birth, his
wretched bringing-up, and withal, the mysterious matter of his
glorious vision.&nbsp; The assertion that the moment he beheld
her, on rescuing her from the robber, he identified her face and
figure with the lady of his dream, called forth her deepest
blushes, and she audibly whispered
&ldquo;Incredible!&rdquo;&nbsp; His repeated assertions,
passionately urged, of the truth of his assertion, silenced and
perhaps convinced her.</p>
<p>Certain it is that, like the gentle Desdemona, &ldquo;She gave
him for his pains a world of sighs;&rdquo; and time evinced to
him that the lady had a tale to tell also, which proved that
although highly born, and affluent as she was, her lot had not
been entire sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am yet hardly twenty-one,&rdquo; replied she,
&ldquo;although I have been twice married.&nbsp; To neither of
these husbands have I been able to give my entire heart.&nbsp; My
first union was at my father&rsquo;s <i>command</i>, when
solicitations proved useless, to his contemporary and old
schoolfellow, who was old-fashioned enough to restore the
long-exploded <i>abs</i> in his name, vaunting himself as Thomas
ab Rhys ab Thomas Gock, of Ystrad Feen; who could carry on the
antique and rusty chain of <i>abs</i>, without a broken link,
through several centuries up to the patriarch of his tribe,
Elystan Glodrydd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old gentleman!&nbsp; I fed him with a pap-spoon,
in his large gothic arm-chair, when a stroke of paralysis had
withered his right hand; but in six months after our marriage
(marriage!) he fell a victim to his ruling passion, which I will
not name to his disparagement, and died of apoplexy.&nbsp; My
year&rsquo;s mourning for him had barely expired, when my mother
claimed her right of choosing my next husband; and, in the course
of time, poor Sir George (peace to the memory of a harmless man!)
became my second husband.&nbsp; Had I lived to these days
unwedded,&rdquo; said she, with a look and tone of resolute
firmness, almost foreign to her usual gentleness, &ldquo;it is
more than probable that I <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>should not have become the victim of
either of my parents&rsquo; whims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor mother has been long deceased; but well I know
my father&rsquo;s future aim respecting me&mdash;to have me
united to some other choice of his own; but no! the sapling may
bend to the storm, but, springing up again, who shall re-bend the
youthful oak that time matures?&nbsp; If my good father inclines
to play the tyrant with me, he will find some difference between
the woman and the child.&rdquo;&nbsp; Applauding her resolution,
Twm, kissed her hand with rapture; and, she added in a tone of
gaiety, &ldquo;if ever I change my state, I shall become the
votary of a different shrine to any that I have yet bowed
to;&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The little god shall shoot the porch,<br />
Ere faithful Hymen waves his torch.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that expressive couplet, she rose, and our hero, with
enlarged hopes, took a tender, but restrained and respectful
leave of her.</p>
<p>If Twm was heartily welcomed by Lady Devereaux, he was no less
heartily disliked by her father.&nbsp; Sir John had learnt that
he was a natural son of Sir John Wynn of Gwydir&rsquo;s, and no
earthly merit could compensate, in his estimation, the bar of
bastardy in his escutcheon.&nbsp; He sternly desired his daughter
to break off all intercourse with our hero, as he had discovered,
he said, the baseness of his origin.&nbsp; Although Twm appeared
no more in his house, he had the mortification to learn that at
the play, the ball, and in the Park and Mall, their meetings had
been frequent.&nbsp; In a bitter spirit of resentment against his
daughter, without the least previous warning, he one morning
compelled her roughly to enter a coach at the door, which soon
drove off, taking her she knew not whither.</p>
<p>Our hero&rsquo;s surmises became numerous and agonizing, when
for three long weeks he had neither seen nor heard from his
charmer, although he had not missed one opportunity of
encountering her at any of <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>their accustomed places of meeting,
and his days became burdensome, and his nights sleepless.&nbsp;
Just as he was sinking into a state of despondency, he one
evening received a note in the hand of Lady Devereaux, informing
him of her forcible conveyance to, and safe arrival at Ystrad
Feen.&nbsp; His father having long since returned to North Wales,
he took an affectionate but hasty leave of the hospitable family
of the Martyns, and commenced his journey to his native
principality.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> in Wales
again.&nbsp; His meeting with the &ldquo;lady of his
dream.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The course of true love never did run
smooth,&rdquo; which Twm ruefully acknowledges.</p>
<p>The dangers of the road had been somewhat reduced by the
vigorous prosecution of highwaymen and robbers, many of whom had
been lately convicted and executed.&nbsp; Travellers could pursue
their way in comparative security, so Twm encountered no
&ldquo;hair-breadth escapes by flood or field&rdquo; and his
journey home, consequently added no exciting incident to swell
his gallant reputation.&nbsp; At Reading, he heard of the late
execution there of his former antagonist Tom Dorbell.</p>
<p>Our hero&rsquo;s impatience towards the close of his journey
was so great that he rode all night, that he might reach Ystrad
Feen a day earlier.&nbsp; How would the &ldquo;lady of his
dream&rdquo; receive him?&nbsp; With what delight would he not
gaze upon her dear face again!&nbsp; When Twm, mounted on a
goodly steed, dashed into the court-yard, Lady Devereaux, who
witnessed his arrival sprang from her seat and hurried to meet
him as he reached the entrance hall.&nbsp; We fear, for the
honour of prudery, that her resistance was not very great.</p>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>When
our gallant hero caught her in his arms, and impressed a certain
number of kisses somewhere about the region of the cheeks and
lips, both of which looked many degrees redder than when, a few
minutes before, she complained to Miss Meredith of his strange
delay in town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss her also, so that she can&rsquo;t tell tales of
me!&rdquo; said the gay young widow; so Twm, somewhat less
ardently, kissed Miss Meredith, and seemed to look about to see
if there were any more business of that kind on hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Jones, you are welcome, most welcome, back
to Wales, and trebly welcome to me, and the lonely walls of
Ystrad Feen,&rdquo; were the kind Lady Joan&rsquo;s first
words.&nbsp; Neither of the ladies was slow in discovering the
change for the better which had taken place in his address, his
former diffidence and indecision of manner being supplanted by
easy confidence, and high animal spirits.</p>
<p>Twm was now, indeed, happy with the &ldquo;lady of his
dream;&rdquo; for he was on much more intimate terms with her
than he had, at one time, ever hoped to be.&nbsp; She told him
that when her father so suddenly forced her into the coach, to be
hurried towards the country, she was joined by two lofty ladies,
his maiden sisters, who literally became her jailors in the
travelling vehicle.&nbsp; Our hero remembered them well, from
seeing them at cards one evening at their brother&rsquo;s; and he
did not fail to describe them to young Martyn, as ugly as
heartless pride, ill-temper, long saturnine noses, yellow ribbons
and slippers, could make them.</p>
<p>The ancient gentlewomen had chosen the state of ceaseless
virginity, they said, to keep up the dignity of the family,
which, in their persons, they proudly added, should never be
lowered by an unworthy alliance.&nbsp; During their homeward
journey, they entertained their victim with ingenious reproaches
and disparaging observations respecting &ldquo;the strange young
man who had obtruded himself into their brother&rsquo;s
house&mdash;the unknown Mr. Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>&ldquo;Why, the creature has no family,&rdquo; observed
the long-waisted Miss Felina Tomtabby Price.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; replied our heroine, &ldquo;he is never
likely to be pestered with the claims of poor relations, nor the
persecution of rich ones.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, he is of no
stock,&rdquo; said Miss Euphemia Polparrot Price, following up
her sister&rsquo;s remark; &ldquo;the creature was only born
yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then he is singularly young and
harmless,&rdquo; answered the lady of Ystrad Feen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And, above all blemishes, he is base-born,&rdquo; added
Miss Felina Tomtabby Price.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is less his fault
than his misfortune, as the Irishman said who warranted his blind
mare free from faults,&rdquo; answered their merry niece.</p>
<p>The young lady was evidently more than a match for the two
elder ones, and so these ancient gentlewomen kept a dignified
silence, or spoke only to each other, during the rest of the
journey; which terminated at length by their seeing her to Ystrad
Feen, and betaking themselves to the Priory House at Brecon.</p>
<p>In the course of many private conversations between Miss
Meredith and the young widow, the subject of which discourses,
strange to say, being invariably Twm himself; she declared
herself delighted with him, and Twm, it was easy to see, returned
the compliment with interest.&nbsp; At her invitation, he became
an inmate of the house, until, as she said, he could put himself
to rights.&nbsp; The golden chain and sum of money left to her
care, were delivered up to him with considerable additions, in
return for his services by a journey to London and from her own
private bounty.</p>
<p>With the evident encouragement vouchsafed to him by the lady
of Ystrad Feen, Twm was soon madly and irrecoverably lost in his
warm affection for her, and there is nothing to surprise any
reasonable being when he is told that Twm, with energetic
enthusiasm, protested that he admired&mdash;nay, loved her!&nbsp;
If the lady chided him, it was with such winning gentleness that
it seemed to say, &ldquo;Pray, do so again.&rdquo;&nbsp; If she
turned aside her head to conceal her blushes, smiles ever
accompanied them, in coming and retreating; or if <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>she
frowned, it was so equivocally, that, for the life of him, our
hero could not help considering each transient bend of the brow
as so many invitations to kiss them away, which the gallant Twm
never failed to accept and obey.</p>
<p>These golden days were too rich in delight to last long.&nbsp;
As the <i>good-natured and most virtuous world</i> discovered
that they were very happy, and pleased with each other, it
breathed forth its malignant spirit, and doubted whether they had
a legitimate right to be so; of course, deciding negatively, and
consequently awarding to the lovers the pains and penalties of
persecution and mutual banishment.</p>
<p>When they had become for some time, undivided companions, and
walked, rode, danced at Brecon balls, and resided under the same
roof together, although under the strict guidance of moral
propriety, as daily witnessed by the lady&rsquo;s female friend;
it will be no wonder that scandal at last became busy with the
lady&rsquo;s fame.&nbsp; An additional incentive for raising
these evil reports was that she had rejected the attentions of
several of the rural noblesse, who had endeavoured to recommend
themselves to her good graces.</p>
<p>All at once like the inmates of a hornet&rsquo;s nest, the
various members of her family, the proud Prices of Brecon, buzzed
about her ears and stung her with their reproaches.&nbsp; She
bore all with determined patience, until assured that her fame
had been vilified, and that she had been described as living a
life of profligacy and dishonour.&nbsp; Conscious of rectitude,
however indiscreet she might have been, the haughtiness of her
spirit now rose, as she indignantly repelled the infamous
charges; in the end, requested her <i>dear friends and
relations</i> to dismiss their tender fears for her reputation,
and keep to their own homes for the future, or at least not to
trouble hers.</p>
<p>Although she had treated her officious friends with the
contumely they deserved, she could not afford to set at nought,
altogether, the opinions of the little world in which she lived;
and, tired, irritated, and <a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>vexed, by hearing the same tale from
day to day, she at last consented to send away her deliverer and
friend, as she called him, from the protection of her roof.&nbsp;
Our hero, however, could never be brought to distinguish between
her real kind feelings towards him, and the constrained
appearance which her altered conduct made in his sight.</p>
<p>Free as the air, as he felt himself, he could not understand
why a great and wealthy lady was not equally unshackled and
independent.&nbsp; Explanations and excuses were entirely thrown
away upon him, as he could not, or would not, understand aught so
opposed to his happiness and pre-conceived notions.</p>
<p>When, at length, it was made known to him that the separation
was inevitable, and the season of it arrived, he received the
astounding intelligence like a severe blow of fortune, that
struck him at once both sorrowful and meditative.&nbsp; Pride and
resentment, from a supposed sense of injury at last supplanted
every other feeling; and, starting up with a frenzied effort, he
ordered his horse to be got ready, and gave directions for his
things to be forwarded to Llandovery; after which, he wrote a
note, and sent it to the lady&rsquo;s room requesting a momentary
interview with her alone, before he took his departure.</p>
<p>She came down with a slow, languid step, and met him in the
parlour.&nbsp; Her eyes were red with weeping; and, before she
uttered a syllable, our hero&rsquo;s much-altered looks affected
her so much, that she burst out into a heavy fit of
sobbing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not think hardly&mdash;do not feel
unkindly towards me, Jones,&rdquo; were her first words!&nbsp;
&ldquo;I entreat you to give me the credit due to my sincerity,
when I assure you that the sacrifice I made on consenting to part
with you, was&mdash;yes! although I have buried two husbands who
loved me tenderly, it was the heaviest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm replied in a tone and manner that evinced both his pride
and his suffering; &ldquo;I have but few words, madame, and they
shall not long intrude upon your leisure.&nbsp; I came here a
stranger, and had some <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>trifling claims, perhaps, on your
attention.&nbsp; Those claims have been more than
satisfied&mdash;noble has been your remuneration of my humble
services, your beneficence generous and princely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A change took place in your destiny; you honoured me
beyond my merits, and bade me stand to the world in a new
character.&nbsp; You called me friend, your sole friend, in a
faithless world; nay, lady, your lover; I loved, and love you
with a pure but unconquerable flame!&nbsp; Blame me not if I am
presumptuous;&mdash;it was your own condescension, your own
encouragement, that made me so, and elevated me to an equality
with yourself.&nbsp; You gave me hopes to be the future, the only
husband of your choice.&nbsp; You stretched forth your hand to
aid my efforts, as I eagerly climbed towards the darling object
of my aim; but before I attained the summit, you, madame, in the
spirit of caprice or treachery, dashed me headlong downwards, to
perish in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your great and wealthy friends will praise you for
this, while the mincing madames and the insipid misses of Brecon
shall learn a noble lesson by your conduct, and emulating you,
become in their day as arrant coquettes and tramplers on manly
hearts, as their limited powers and vanity will permit.&nbsp; But
enough! you shall have your generous triumph,&mdash;and from this
hour I tread the world without an aim, a wanderer in the
wilderness, reckless of everything.&nbsp; Advancement,
estimation, I here abjure; nor, from this hour, would I raise my
hand to save from annihilation the being I am&mdash;for life is
henceforth hateful to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, farewell!&mdash;never more will I cross your
path; but you may hear of my wayward steps,&mdash;and if in me
you are told of a wretched idiot, a being whose mind had perished
while his frame was strong, remember that it was yourself who
wrought that mental desolation.&nbsp; Or, if they name me as a
lawless being, plunged head-long into deeds of guilt, remember it
is you, you, madame, who are the authoress of my crimes and
sorrows, and, may be, of an ignominious death.&nbsp; And <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>now,
madame, farewell!&rdquo;&nbsp; On which he darted out, mounted
his horse, and rode off; while the unhappy lady of Ystrad Feen,
whose agitation choked her utterance, caught a last glimpse of
him, and fell on the parlour floor in a swoon.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Fine</span> Arts at a
discount.&nbsp; Hungry Moses, whose appetite was his ruin.&nbsp;
New tricks and jokes on Ready Rosser.&nbsp; Parson Inco once
more.</p>
<p>Twm left Ystrad Feen in no enviable state of mind.&nbsp; He
was in a similar temper to that of a child when deprived of a
favourite toy, and as he urged his horse with speed in the
direction of Llandovery, he determined never to place faith in
woman again,&mdash;a resolution which underwent some slight
modification before he reached the &ldquo;Cat and Fiddle,&rdquo;
a diminutive-looking ale-house, where for the present he decided
to take up his quarters.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his chagrin, he could not help smiling at this
whimsical sign, then newly painted,&mdash;a droll-faced creature
of the feline race, drawn, as an enthusiast in melody, erect on
her hind feet, her eyes turned up in ecstacy, while her open
mouth seemed to be mewing music, or tow-rowing harmony at a fine
rate, in concord with the fiddle that she handled with the most
artist-like taste, and professional gravity.&nbsp; If the sign
was to his taste, a sort of homely snuggery in the form of a
small parlour, and a good-humoured-looking fat landlady, were no
less so.</p>
<p>Dinah Dew, the widowed mistress of the Cat and Fiddle informed
him that she owed her sign to the skill of a poor tramping
painter, who had run into her debt, to the enormous amount of
five shillings and sevenpence half-penny, for board, washing,
lodging, and drinking: and the poor fellow being penniless <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>and without
work, &ldquo;I let him free,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for the
sign, and gave him a shilling and a brown loaf over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This liberal patronage of the fine arts, (for the sign
included music, poetry, and painting,) gave Twm a favourable
opinion of his hostess.&nbsp; She apologized to him for the
absence of her hostler, and said he was a poor ragged fellow with
a pregnant wife, and two children; by trade a mat and basket
maker; also a waiter at two other taverns; and an occasional
husbandry servant with several farmers, who employed him in their
busy times.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fellow is well enough,&rdquo; said
the little round woman, &ldquo;but for his cormorant appetite;
and eat what he may, he never looks better for it.&nbsp; Indeed
your horse would scarcely be safe with him, but that this is not
the most hungry time of year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew such another once,&rdquo; thought Twm, his mind
reverting to the hungry house of Morris Greeg; as he went forward
on his walk over the fields.&nbsp; The said &ldquo;hostler&rdquo;
soon overtook him, to ask his commands about his horse.&nbsp; Twm
looked with compassion on the ragged Guy Fawkes figure before
him, and conceived that he might earn a fair livelihood by merely
walking over the farmer&rsquo;s grounds, as all the kites and
crows must inevitably flap their departing wings at his
approach.&nbsp; Twm looked into a keen pair of ferret eyes, that
glistened above a high-bridged parrot nose, and found no
difficulty in identifying the miserable Moses of past days.</p>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s spirit of joking was rampant within him,
notwithstanding the morning&rsquo;s vexations, and he determined
upon having a little fun, in refreshing Moses&rsquo;s memory
regarding a few incidents which were best forgotten.&nbsp;
Assuming an attitude of tremendous importance, and overwhelming
authority, he commenced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the very fellow I have been long seeking.&nbsp;
You ran away from the comfortable and very plentiful house of
Morris Greeg, in Cardiganshire; after having in concert with a
young scamp, named Twm Shon Catty, eaten all his pork and
mutton.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moses started and <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>looked blue
as indigo.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have thee put in stocks, and
taken back to the house of that generous and most injured
man,&rdquo; cried Twm, in the tone of a jack-in-office.</p>
<p>Compassionating the perplexity of the poor devil, he caught
his hand and cried, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know me?&mdash;Twm,
your former fellow-starveling.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, well!
who could have thought it!&rdquo; cried the astonished Moses;
&ldquo;dear, dear, what a many good dinners you must have had to
make you look so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm assured him, he should have dinners too, if he behaved
himself, but charged him to be silent as to their former
acquaintance.&nbsp; Moses so bounced and bounded up, in token of
his rapture, that Twm feared the wind would bear away the poor
creature like a paper kite from him.</p>
<p>Poor fellow! anticipating warmth and comfort from such a
proceeding, he married a very fat widow of a butcher, who was
accomplished in her husband&rsquo;s calling.&nbsp; Moses had
often sought the pleasant shelter of her slaughter-house, and
amusingly admired the dexterous and delicate manner in which she
cut the throats, and flayed the hides off the subjects that she
operated on; inasmuch that he conceived the creatures themselves
ought to be delighted at being so skilfully finished.&nbsp; After
he had wooed and won the widow, oftentimes, when she was almost
broken-hearted at her failing to sell certain joints towards the
close of the market-day, Moses would be in raptures, as he
feelingly observed, they would eat the unsold portion
themselves.&nbsp; Somehow their trade gradually declined, till
latterly it ceased altogether, and the widow was no longer a
butcher, owing, as she protested, to her husband&rsquo;s being a
&ldquo;huge feeder,&rdquo; and the mysterious disappearance of
various joints that she suspected him of devouring in secret.</p>
<p>Where were now the lover&rsquo;s despair and tears, his
dedication to a life of solitude, nay, his refusal even of
life?&nbsp; True, for some days, Twm stalked about in the
neighbourhood of the &ldquo;Cat and Fiddle&rdquo; as if his <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>earthly
mission had been brought to a sudden termination; as if, like
Othello, his occupation was gone, and there was no likelihood of
any other suitable employment turning up.&nbsp; Alas for the
consistency of the lover!&mdash;days we repeat, and not weeks nor
months, much less years, of seclusion of this kind.&nbsp; He soon
illustrated the Shaksperian adage, &ldquo;Men have died, and
worms have eaten them, but not for love.&rdquo;&nbsp; But by him
everything was to be done by strokes of impulse.&nbsp; To banish
his cares, he plunged at once into intemperance; and from merely
tolerating a little cheerful company, he entered the society of
the greatest topers and madcaps to be found, till he emulated and
outdid the highest, and became the very prince of wags and
practical jokers.</p>
<p>He was of course recognized as the conqueror of the tremendous
Dio the Devil, and the acknowledged preserver of the lady of
Ystrad Feen, which, with his relation of many freaks and vagaries
in England, together with the assured fact that he had been once
to London, and spent a year there, gained him no inconsiderable
share of celebrity.</p>
<p>The good-humoured Justice Prothero, he found as merry, and as
much a friend as ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fear not for the fair widow,
boy!&rdquo; would he exclaim, slapping him heartily on the back;
&ldquo;she&rsquo;ll have thee yet, in spite of the long-nosed
Prices and their pedigrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To divert him from his frequent fits of melancholy, and
dangerous freaks of folly among his newly-made companions at
Llandovery, Prothero would keep him a week at a time under his
friendly roof, and make trifling bets, to amuse him, by which
freaks he secured some enjoyment for himself also.</p>
<p>Ready Rosser again became his antagonist in these rustic feats
and stratagems.&nbsp; The first wager that Prothero laid, was of
twenty shillings, that Twm would not by his cunning decoy a sheep
out of the safe keeping of this worthy, as he was to fetch one
home for butchering on the morrow; but if he succeeded, the
mutton and the money would both <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>become his own; otherwise he would
forfeit that sum and resign the woolly victim to its owner.&nbsp;
To all this our hero agreed, and prepared accordingly.</p>
<p>Ready Rosser was as loud in bidding defiance to our hero, now
as he had been on a former occasion, where the result had
scarcely justified his extravagant bragging.&nbsp; He shouldered
his sheep, vowing before his grinning fellow-servants, who
grouped round to crack their jests on him, that the devil himself
should not deprive him of his burden.&nbsp; As he proceeded along
a part of the high road, up a slight ascent, he discovered with
surprise, a good leathern shoe lying in the mud.&nbsp; A shoe of
leather, be it known, in a country where wooden clogs are
generally worn, is no despicable prize.&nbsp; Rosser looked at
the object before him with a longing eye; but reflecting that one
shoe, however good, was useless unmatched with a fellow, spared
himself the trouble of stooping, for troublesome it would have
been with such a weight on his shoulders, and passed on without
lifting it.&nbsp; On walking a little farther, and going round a
bend in the road, great was his surprise on finding another shoe,
a fellow to the former, lying in the sledge mark, which like the
rut of a wheel, indented the mud with hollow stripes.&nbsp; In
the height of his joy he laid down the sheep, with its legs tied,
beside the shoe, and ran back for the other; when Twm Shon Catty,
watching his opportunity, sprang over the hedge, and seized his
prize, which he bore off securely; won his bet, and ate his
mutton undisturbed.</p>
<p>The termination of this sheep wager did not add to Ready
Rosser&rsquo;s reputation, and that worthy was nearly beside
himself with rage, on finding himself again beaten.&nbsp; His
master, Squire Prothero, although the most good-humoured of
country gentlemen, was rather angry with Rosser, whose shrewdness
always became questionable when opposed to Twm&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It
was admitted, in excuse, that the most cunning at times may be
accidentally over-reached by his inferior in wit.&nbsp; On this
plea the merry magistrate was conciliated, and induced into <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>another
wager, precisely like the former, when a similar sum, against our
hero, and in favour of his servant, was laid and accepted.&nbsp;
The man of shrewdness, as before, determined to use the utmost
vigilance and caution to preserve his charge and redeem his
reputation.&nbsp; He grasped his load, which was a fine fat ewe,
most manfully, and swore violent oaths in answer to his
master&rsquo;s exhortation to chariness, that human ingenuity
should never trick him again; but</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Great protestations do make that
doubted,<br />
Which we would else right willingly believe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his way to Llangattock, he had to pass through a wood,
which he had scarcely entered, when the bleating of a sheep
attracted his attention, and he came to a dead stand, as he
intently listened to what he conceived a well-known voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Baa&mdash;baa!&rdquo; again saluted his ear.&nbsp; A
sudden conviction rushed across his mind, that this was the very
sheep he had before lost, which he imagined might have been
concealed by Twm in the recess of the woody dingle.</p>
<p>What a glorious chance, thought he, of recovering his lost
credit with his master, and depriving his antagonist of his
laurels!&nbsp; He instantly deposited his burden beneath a tree;
and eagerly forcing his way through the copse and bushes, he
followed the bleating a considerable way down the wood, when to
his great dismay it ceased altogether.&nbsp; A thought now struck
him, though rather too late, that the bleating proceeded from no
sheep, but a more subtle ram, in the presence of Twm Shon Catty;
he hurried back in a grievous fright, and found his surmises but
too true&mdash;the second sheep, and his high reputation for
shrewdness, had both taken flight together.</p>
<p>Moses&rsquo;s face and figure began to improve, for he
received the greater proportion of the winnings both of money and
mutton, and he secretly thanked the good fortune which had
brought him into Twm&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>Squire Prothero, not yet being tired of our hero&rsquo;s witty
genius and cunning cleverness, offered to oppose <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>to his
cunning, the collective vigilance of his husbandmen and maidens;
laying a bet with him that he should not steal a white ox, with
which a black one was to be yoked to the plough.&nbsp; The plough
to be held by Rosser and driven by another servant; while two
girls, driving each a harrow, should also be on their guard, to
prevent his aim if possible.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt that Twm would accept this wager as he
had done the others, and accordingly he very obligingly undertook
to convey away the white ox, as he had formerly done the bull
Bishop; and to eat the gentleman&rsquo;s beef, provided it turned
out sufficiently tender; protesting with a half yawn, and the
perfect ease of a modern Corinthian, that he was absolutely tired
of mutton, which he had too long persisted in eating, against the
judgment and advice of his physician.</p>
<p>The morning at length dawned, when the test of Twm&rsquo;s
sagacity, the most severe to which it had yet been exposed, was
to be applied.&nbsp; The plough was guided and the cattle driven,
while two bare-footed maidens giggled and laughed till the rocks
echoed, as they whipped the horses and ran by their sides, till
the harrows bounced against the stones, and sometimes turned
over; their mirth was excited by the idea of Twm&rsquo;s folly in
accepting such a bet, and thinking to steal the white ox from
under their noses, the impossibility of which was so evident.</p>
<p>The two servants at the plough also cracked and enjoyed their
clumsy jokes at the thought of our hero&rsquo;s temerity, at the
same time keeping a wary eye in every direction, armed against
surprisals, and exulting in the thought that for once, at least,
the dexterous Twm would be baffled in his aim.&nbsp; Time went
on; the day waned away towards the evening, and as their fatigue
increased, their vigilance gradually lessened.</p>
<p>Such was the state of matters when Moses, who seemed to be
loitering about without any particular purpose in view,
encountered them, and, laughing loudly at the cautious and
careful way in which they continued to <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>guard their
prize, assured them that Twm had given up the idea of outwitting
such a wary and clever party, and was at that moment drinking his
wine with their master, whom he allowed to win the wager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allowing, indeed!&rdquo; quoth a sharp-tongued lass, as
she stopped her harrow to listen, &ldquo;pretty allowing, when he
could not help himself!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; cried the
other girl, &ldquo;so the fox allowed the goose to escape, when
she took to flight and escaped his clutches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosser and the plough-boy exulted in their anticipated reward
of a skin-full of strong beer.&nbsp; Thus the whole party was
excited to a high pitch of triumphant mirth.&nbsp; Moses was, of
course, a decoy, and his report had really the effect of throwing
them off their guard, which another circumstance contributed to
aid.&nbsp; The rural party had rested, sitting on their ploughs
and harrows, at one end of the field, while they listened to
their informant; and now were about to resume their labours, when
a hare started from the adjoining thicket, crossing the ground
towards the opposite hedge.</p>
<p>Suddenly the halloo arose; away ran the ploughman and girls,
over hedges and ditches, and away ran the yelping sheep-dog, amid
the clamour of shouting and barking; but the wondering oxen stood
still, and their grave looks of astonishment gradually changed to
a more animated expression of alarm on the arrival of Twm Shon
Catty.</p>
<p>Having loosed his captive hare to decoy the clowns, he availed
himself of their absence to dress the black ox in a white morning
gown,&mdash;that is to say, a sheet, which became him much, and
contrasted with his complexion amazingly; and the white ox he
attired in a suit of mourning, formed of the burial pall which he
had borrowed from the clerk of Llandingad church for that express
purpose; and, having unloosened his fair friend from the yoke,
they suddenly disappeared through a gap in the hedge.</p>
<p>Although busily engaged in the gentlemanly pastime of the
chase, the husbandry worthies now and <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>then glanced towards the plough, but
seeing, as they thought, the white ox safe, returned to it at a
leisurely pace, till quickened, as they neared it, by the
singular sight before them; and their petty vexation at losing
the hare was now swallowed up by the terrible circumstance of
their loss of their especial charge.&nbsp; A suitable lamentation
followed, of course, which was succeeded by fear and trembling,
from a conviction that Twm Shon Catty dealt with the devil; and
that the hare which they had chased was no other than the foe of
man in disguise.&nbsp; This reasonable and self-evident
assumption quite satisfied their merry master, who deemed himself
quite compensated for his loss by the hearty laugh he
enjoyed.</p>
<p>Twm and his singular charge entered Llandovery in triumph, the
white ox being gaily decorated with ribbons, and the
half-starved, but trustworthy, Moses seated on its back.&nbsp;
Loud were the huzzas and laughter by which he was received by the
juvenile part of the population of Llandovery; not one of whom
enjoyed the sight more than the good-humoured Prothero, who
cheerfully paid the bet, and from a tavern window had full view
of the scene, which he declared excited his laughter till his
heart and sides ached with the agreeable convulsion.</p>
<p>Twm did not confine himself to love of beef and mutton.&nbsp;
He had higher aspirations which evinced a very ardent passion for
horse-flesh; and pursued it with all the fiery zest of a
first-love, when impeded by difficulties the most
insurmountable.</p>
<p>The lady of Ystrad Feen, still sitting on his heart like a
night-mare, and pinching it with pain rendered him, however
amusing to others, miserable enough within himself.&nbsp;
Lassitude, chagrin, and bitterness, often betrayed themselves in
his countenance and manners, and were only transiently removed by
the hilarity of the company with which he mixed, or the freaks
which he played, in his ill-combined humours of mirth and
sorrow.&nbsp; Reckless of consequences, he now entered into the
follies less innocent than hitherto <a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>detailed; led to them, however, more
by a spirit of youthful wildness than by any really criminal
intention.</p>
<p>In one of his many walks he found himself one day at
Machynlleth, in Montgomeryshire, and who should he see but his
old enemy Inco Evans of Tregaron, riding into the town on a fine
grey horse?&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;my dear
friend still alive!&nbsp; Now is that horse to be mine or
his?&rdquo; said he to himself, as he produced a copper coin;
&ldquo;now heads for Inco, and tails for Twm,&rdquo; added he, as
he tossed the penny high up in the air.&nbsp; On its fall to the
ground he found that fortune had declared against the parson.</p>
<p>With the utmost coolness he made himself known to the amiable
Inco, whose features underwent various contortions at the
recognition; nor did they settle to serenity when Twm with
provoking laughter told him that he must journey homeward on
foot, as it was a settled thing fixed by fate, that he was to
have the gallant grey himself.&nbsp; Inco started and stared;
but, without answering a word, he hurried to the innkeeper and
the hostler, charging them to lock the stable, and assist him to
secure a daring delinquent whom he had discovered in the
street.&nbsp; On reaching the stable, the grey, like the grey
mist of morning, had dissolved from view, and our hero was
equally invisible in the ancient town of Machynlleth.</p>
<p>This last transaction sat uneasily on Twm&rsquo;s
conscience.&nbsp; He thought that it hardly came within the
legitimate bounds of a joke, although the free and unlicensed
spirit of the times permitted a long tether in this respect; he
therefore promised himself some mirth in returning the grey horse
to Inco, if he could be found in a Welshpool fair, which was
probable, as the accumulating clerical magistrate was a great
trafficker in farm stock of all kinds.&nbsp; Thither proceeded
the gallant Twm, on a fine Monday morning, in the following week;
but the purpose of his better thoughts was unluckily
thwarted.</p>
<p><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>On
entering this little wool-combing town, a certain countenance
burst upon his recollection; the owner of the face made known to
him as a stranger, and made overtures for the purchase of the
steed.&nbsp; It struck our hero that there would be some fun in
selling it to this personage&mdash;no other than young Marmaduke
Graspacre&mdash;as it could not but cause a whimsical altercation
with Inco Evans.&nbsp; Accordingly a bargain was struck, and Twm
received the amount in hard cash.</p>
<p>Both parties were highly pleased with their transaction, and
Twm praised the grey steed still more warmly now that he had
pocketed the money.&nbsp; He spoke quite enthusiastically of the
animal&rsquo;s points, remarking that its merits were far away in
excess of what he had represented them to be.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
protest to you in honesty and truth,&rdquo; he exclaimed with
much earnestness, &ldquo;you have a greater bargain than you
imagine.&nbsp; As I was not anxious to sell him, I have omitted
to inform you of half his good qualities; he is capable of
performing such wonderful feats as you never heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; exclaimed the elated
Marmaduke, staring alternately at his horse and at our
hero.&nbsp; &ldquo;In fact, I assure you,&rdquo; cries Twm, with
the most sober face imaginable; &ldquo;and if you don&rsquo;t
believe me, I&rsquo;ll convince you in a moment, if you will
allow me to mount him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, certainly, with
many thanks,&rdquo; quoth the delighted heir of Graspacre
Hall.&nbsp; Twm very leisurely mounted, and after a variety of
postures and curvetings, gradually got out of the fair into the
high-road; suddenly giving spur and rein to the &ldquo;gallant
steed,&rdquo; he astonished Marmaduke by his disappearance.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;green&rdquo; one had to confess with bitterness of
heart, that the jockey had certainly kept his word, as he showed
him such a trick as he never before saw, or heard of.&nbsp; But
when he received a note informing him that the horse-dealer was
his old &ldquo;friend&rdquo; Twm, his wrath was boundless.</p>
<p>The fame of Twm&rsquo;s cunning and adroitness spread <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>through the
whole country round, and his wide-spread reputation brought him
many country people to consult him respecting their
difficulties.</p>
<p>One morning, while sitting in his favourite corner at the Cat
and Fiddle, a person called, who described himself as a small
farmer in the neighbourhood, his name Morgan Thomas; and having
heard so much of his cleverness, he came to ask his advice on an
affair of great weight.&nbsp; He had been annoyed, he said, by
the continual trespassing of a certain squire&rsquo;s pigeons on
his ground, which had made such a havoc amid his wheat yearly,
that the loss was grievous to him; he had computed his damages,
and applied for the amount, for the last four years; reckoning
that the forty pigeons would devour at least a bushel of wheat
each annually.&nbsp; The squire only laughed at his claims and
complaints, telling him he might pound them and be d&mdash;d, if
he liked when he would pay the alleged damages and not till
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, to pound them, I should like vastly,&rdquo; quoth
Morgan Thomas, &ldquo;but without the squire&rsquo;s polite
invitation to be d&mdash;ned, at the same time.&nbsp; But,&rdquo;
added the poor farmer, &ldquo;pounding pigeons, I look upon as
impossible; yet as you have done feats no less wonderful, if you
will pound those mischievous pigeons for me, I will engage to
give you half the amount of my claims.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Agreed?&rdquo; cried Twm, and grasped his hand, in token
that he undertook the task.</p>
<p>He sent a quantity of hot grains from the brewing, to the
farmer, next morning, which he afterwards scattered about the
farm-yard.&nbsp; The pigeons came, as usual; and eagerly
devouring the grain, each and all soon appeared as top-heavy as
the veriest tress-pot in Carmarthenshire; and, like the said
fraternity incapable of returning home, they fell in stupor on
the ground.&nbsp; Our hero, assisted by the farmer, picked them
up, tied their legs, and put the whole party in the pound.&nbsp;
The squire, who was no other than Prothero, the laughing
magistrate, ever pleased with a jest, especially when cracked by
our hero, immediately paid the farmer&rsquo;s demand; <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>and Twm
generously refused the proffered remuneration for his very
effective assistance.</p>
<p>Our hero never used the money acquired by his art for his own
requirements, and we must not forget to say here that the cash
our hero received for the parson&rsquo;s horse, was cast into the
parish poor-box.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm&rsquo;s</span>
poetical address to his &ldquo;lady love.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A
gipsy&rsquo;s life is a joyous life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dinas and a
singular natural cave.&nbsp; Faithless woman.</p>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s thoughts were not often forgetful of Ystrad Feen,
and its inhabitants: the lady &ldquo;of the ilk&rdquo; seldom
indulged in silent reverie, without making the absent Twm the
principal figure in her day-dream.&nbsp; She had not known a
day&rsquo;s peace since his absence, and was daily waving between
a resolution to send for him back, to bestow on him her hand, and
a deference for her father and proud relatives, who insisted that
if she ever married again, it should only be to a title and
fortune; by which they themselves might share in the honour.</p>
<p>Information was brought to her of his wild excesses, which
gave her the greatest concern, as she conceived herself in part
the authoress of his misfortunes.&nbsp; Twm, at the same time,
felt that his tedious absence from the fair widow was no longer
to be endured; and as he knew her to be watched by her
father&rsquo;s spies, he determined on paying her a visit in
disguise.&nbsp; Previous to putting his design into execution, he
composed and sent her the following poem, in which he dwells on,
and exaggerates, his own misfortunes, in a strain calculated to
move her tenderness in his favour.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>CYWYDD Y
GOVID. <a name="citation264"></a><a href="#footnote264"
class="citation">[264]</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> outcast&rsquo;s forced ally is
mine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Govid is his name;<br />
It is a ruthless savage mate,<br />
And like a foe that&rsquo;s pale with hate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To crush me is his aim:<br />
His cruel shafts are fiercely hurl&rsquo;d,<br />
He forced me friendless on the world.</p>
<p>If forward, seeking good I wend,<br />
My eager steps outstrip the fiend;<br />
If backward I retreat from ill,<br />
My cruel foe arrests me still:</p>
<p>I seek the flood to end despair,<br />
Relentless Govid meets me there,<br />
And tells of endless pangs of pride,<br />
The wages of the suicide.</p>
<p>Fell Govid&rsquo;s mighty in the land,<br />
His children are a horrid band,<br />
Who joy in hapless man&rsquo;s distress,<br />
Lo, one in debt&mdash;one nakedness:&mdash;<br />
And need against me doth combine;<br />
(Fierce Govid&rsquo;s loveless concubine;)<br />
And care, that knows not how to yearn,<br />
Is Govid&rsquo;s consort, keen and stern:<br />
And thus this family of ill,<br />
E&rsquo;er bruise my heart and curb my will.</p>
<p>Though lost to me the tranquil day,<br />
My vanquisher I hope to slay;<br />
The fierce enormous giant fiend<br />
No more the heart of Twm shall rend,<br />
If thou, my lady-love! but smile,<br />
Thou gentle fair, devoid of guile&mdash;<br />
Thou darling object of my choice,<br />
Oh bless me with assentive voice,<br />
And soon shall Govid lay his length,<br />
A curse! struck down by Rapture&rsquo;s strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lady of Ystrad Feen did not read the pathetic poem without
being deeply affected, and tears ran down her fair cheeks as she
sobbingly perused it for the fourth <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>time.&nbsp; She still bowed her head
in grief, when her maid entered her chamber, and in a tone of
complaint informed her mistress that there was a very important
and troublesome gipsy in the kitchen, who, after having told the
fortunes of all the servants in the house, insisted on seeing her
also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not in a mood to relish such foolery now, so send
her about her business,&rdquo; answered the lady, in a tone more
sorrowful than angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is quite useless,&rdquo;
replied the girl, &ldquo;to attempt to send her away; big Evan
the gardener tried to take her by the shoulders, and turn her out
by force, but she whirled round, grasped him by his arms, tripped
up his heels, and laid him in a moment on the floor.&nbsp; There
she sits in the kitchen, and vows she will not budge from thence
for either man or woman, till she sees the Lady of Ystrad Feen,
whom she loves, she says, dearer than her life, and would not for
millions harm a hair of her head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although too deeply absorbed in sorrow to have curiosity much
excited, she went down stairs, and approached the sybil, who had
now taken her station in the hall, asking her, &ldquo;What do you
want, my good woman?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To tell you,&rdquo;
answered she, &ldquo;not your fortune, but what may be your
fortune if you choose.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me hear
then,&rdquo; said the Lady Joan, with a faint incredulous smile,
walking before her, at the same time, into a little back
parlour.&nbsp; Before she could seat herself, the apparent gipsy
caught her right hand wrist, and looking round, whispered in her
ear,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To heal your torn bosom, and ease every
smart,<br />
Oh take&mdash;he&rsquo;s before you&mdash;the youth of thy
heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The colour fled from the fair widow&rsquo;s cheeks, and in a
moment she sank into a swoon in her lover&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp;
Soon recovering, she desired her maid to deny her to every body
that called, &ldquo;as,&rdquo; added she, with a smile, &ldquo;I
have particular business with the gipsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A scene of tears and tenderness ensued; when Twm, <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>with the
utmost fervour, urged his suit.&nbsp; She replied that her father
had insisted on, and received her promise that she should wed no
being but who either bore a title or stood within a prospect of
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did well,&rdquo; replied our hero, with the most
easy confidence, &ldquo;and your promise, so far from militating
against me, would really be in my favour, for am I not the son of
a baronet? his nature child, &rsquo;tis true, but still his son;
and you would break no promise to your father in marrying me; but
if you did, so much the better broke than kept.&nbsp; I have
friends at this moment who are doing their utmost to move my
father, Sir John Wynn, of Gwydir, to own me publicly, for his
right worthy son; and if he does not, the loss is his, not mine,
for I shall certainly disown him else for a father, and claim
parentage of some greater man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this interview, Twm pleaded his affection with such
persuasive vigour and tender persistence, that the old
&ldquo;lady of his dream&rdquo; resisted the promptings of her
own heart no longer, and promised to be his in spite of every
obstacle.&nbsp; The joy of our hero knew no bounds, nor did the
lady very strenuously resist his rapturous embraces; but seemed
to find her heart relieved by the resolution she had come to,
that now for ever put an end to the conflicting doubts as to her
future course, which had so long torn her heart, and banished her
peace.</p>
<p>It was now time for the pretended gipsy to depart, as the sun
was descending rapidly, and Twm was chary of the fair
widow&rsquo;s reputation.&nbsp; He would not have the faintest
breath of slander associated with her name and so he unwillingly
left.&nbsp; She directed him to wait for her, and her
confidential friend Miss Meredith, at the entrance to the ancient
cave on the top of Dinas, which was the name of the conical hill
exactly fronting the mansion of Ystrad Feen.&nbsp; He accordingly
took his departure; and winding round the base of Dinas, he
crossed the river <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>Towey, which, being then in summer, was there little
more than a brook.</p>
<p>After walking over a couple of fields, and a piece of rough
common, he had to cross the Towey once more, when he commenced
his ascent at the only part of this very steep hill where it was
possible to climb.</p>
<p>During his former stay at Ystrad Feen, this wildly-romantic
height had been his favourite haunt, as the cave in its side was
the greatest wonder.&nbsp; It was in fact a mighty mound, that
bore all the appearance of having been, at the period of its
formation, convulsed by an earthquake, and in the height of
nature&rsquo;s tremendous heavings, suddenly arrested and
becalmed, even while the huge crags were in the act of tumbling
down its steep sides.</p>
<p>A narrow valley encircled its base, and the mountains around
of equal height with itself, separated only by this deep and
scanty dell, seemed as if rent from it, during the convulsions of
the earth, and Dinas left alone, an interesting monument of the
memorable event.&nbsp; The surface of the acclivity was so
speckled with huge loose stones, that it was dangerous to hold by
them in ascending, as the slightest impetus would roll them
downward.</p>
<p>Once in poetical mood, when accompanied by his mistress, while
tenderly and lovingly protecting her during their ascent at this
very spot, he had said, that no doubt an earthquake had turned
the bosom of the hill inside out, so that no secret could be
therein concealed: archly insinuating that he trusted the time
would soon come, when, without so violent a process, her own fair
bosom would be equally open to him, while it rejected the stony
barriers that then stood between him and her heart.</p>
<p>But let us proceed with our description, while Twm awaits the
arrival, according to promise, of the Lady of Ystrad Feen.</p>
<p>The approach to this curious place was as romantic as the cave
itself.&nbsp; It was through a narrow aperture, formed of two
immense slate rocks that face each other, <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>with the
space between them narrower at the bottom than the top, so that
the passage could be entered only side-ways, with the figure
inclined forward, according to the slant of the rocks, a thin
person being barely able to make his way in, while a man of some
rotundity might also succeed, rising on his toes, forcing himself
upwards.&nbsp; Between these rocks of entrance a massive stone
block was wedged at the top, so that it formed a rude resemblance
to an arch.</p>
<p>After <i>sideling</i> so far through a comparatively long
passage, it was a great surprise that it led to so small a cave;
for it was scarcely large enough to shelter three persons huddled
close together.&nbsp; What it wanted in breadth, it possessed in
height, as it ran up like a chimney, to the attitude of
forty-five feet, and was opened at the top to the very summit of
the mount, forming a skylight to the <i>room</i> below.&nbsp;
Although the little cave was void of a solid roof, a very rural
one was formed by the large tufts of heather and fern, which
sprung through the crevices of the rocks; the whole being
surmounted by the pendant branch of a dwarf oak, that with many
other trees stood like a crown on the elevated head of Dinas.</p>
<p>However singular the interior of this cave might appear to our
hero, he had great pleasure in examining the grand combination
that graced its exterior.&nbsp; There he saw, with
never-satisfied delight and wonder, objects of the most romantic
character, curiously united, near the junction of the three
counties.&nbsp; The rocky Dinas, with its many inaccessible
sides, besides the loose crags before mentioned, was partially
covered with aged dwarfish trees, all bending in the same
direction; many with their heads broken by tempests, but still
throwing out branches, while others, stark, sere, and shrouded in
green moss, were things to which seasons brought no change.</p>
<p>From the mouth of the cave a beautiful view was obtained of
the well-wooded mountain of Maesmaddegan, while the junction of
the rivers Towey and <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>Dorthea <a name="citation269"></a><a
href="#footnote269" class="citation">[269]</a> enlivened the
gloom caused by the deep gulf which separated Dinas.</p>
<p>Twm was, however, careless for this once of the extremely
attractive character of the scenery around him.&nbsp; One of the
most interesting pages in the Book of Nature lay open before him,
but it remained unperused, unnoticed at his feet.&nbsp; His eager
eye was fixed steadily on the spot where it would catch the
earliest glimpse of his approaching mistress.&nbsp; Out of all
patience at her long delay, he now began to wonder at the cause
of it; when at length, to his great dismay, he saw <i>one</i>
female hurrying on, and her not the one, although the faithful
Miss Meredith.</p>
<p>Having reached the side of the river, which separated her from
the base of Dinas, and finding that he was watching her, she
placed a paper on the rock, and a stone upon it, then kissing her
hand sportively, turned about and hastened homeward with the
utmost precipitation.&nbsp; In his eagerness to overtake her, Twm
attempted to run down the declivity, but soon lost his footing,
sliding and rolling down several yards, by which he was for a few
moments rather stunned.&nbsp; Losing all hope of overtaking his
mistress&rsquo;s confidante, he applied to the paper on the rock,
which he found to be a note hastily scrawled with a pencil,
containing merely these words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father has unexpectedly arrived, with several of his
friends&mdash;can&rsquo;t see you at Llandovery on the Fair
day.&nbsp; Yours ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By the Dood!&rdquo;
muttered Twm to himself, &ldquo;if this is a coquette&rsquo;s
trick which she put on me, it shall avail her nothing;&mdash;mine
she is, by promise, and mine she shall be, in spite of the devil,
and all her Brecknockshire friends to boot!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Determined to bring his affairs to a speedy crisis, he changed
his clothes, and soon made his way to Llandovery.</p>

270</span>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> assumes various
disguises, and accomplishes many clever things at Llandovery
fair.&nbsp; A strange scene in a court of justice.&nbsp; Twm
flies and is pursued.</p>
<p>Twm set off to Llandovery fair with a fluttering heart and
hopeful anticipations of seeing his mistress, and planned another
little drama, in which he intended the grey horse should have an
important part.</p>
<p>Much to their credit, the neighbouring gentry had recently
opened a subscription for rebuilding between thirty and forty
poor people&rsquo;s houses, which had unfortunately been burnt
down; and our hero resolved that every farthing henceforward
gained by the grey horse, or otherwise, clandestinely, should be
appropriated to this laudable purpose.&nbsp; It was no small
satisfaction to him to find that, while it mortified the
purse-proud vanity of the haughty squires to see so large a sum
attached to his name, it had the good effect of increasing their
contributions, resolved not to be outdone, in money matters at
least, by so obscure a personage as Twm.</p>
<p>It was necessary for him to disguise himself thoroughly, for
he intended, in the first place, to offer the horse for
sale.&nbsp; He decided to dress as a country booby; and after he
had finished, his most intimate friend would have been puzzled to
recognize him.&nbsp; Twm Shon Catty, (we beg his pardon,) Mr.
Thomas Jones was effectually concealed in the rough garb of a
Welsh country ploughman.&nbsp; His feet got thrust into a very
heavy pair of clogs, or wooden-soled shoes, which being stiff and
large, maintained such a haughty independence of the inmates, as
to need being tied on by a hay-band.&nbsp; His legs were
enveloped in a pair of wheat-stalk leggings, or bands of twisted
straw, winding round and round, and covering them from the knee
to the ankle.</p>
<p><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>A raw
hairy cow-hide formed the material of his <i>inexpressibles</i>,
which were loose, like trowsers cut at the knee; and his jerkin
was of a brick-dust red, with black stripes, like the faded garb
of the Carmarthenshire women.&nbsp; A load of red locks, straight
as a bunch of carrots, hung dangling behind, but in front rather
matted and entangled, quite innocent of the slightest
acquaintance with that useful article, a comb; the whole
surmounted with a soldier&rsquo;s cast-off Monmouth cap, so
highly varnished with grease, as to appear waterproof.</p>
<p>Without any apology for a waistcoat, he wore a blue flannel
shirt, striped with white, opened from the chin to the waistband,
to contain his enormous cargo of bread and cheese and leeks,
which, as he was continually drawing upon his store, stood a
chance of all becoming wholly inside passengers.&nbsp; Added to
this, his booby gait and stupid vacant stare was such that he
might have passed muster anywhere for what he pretended to
be.</p>
<p>He took up his post on the outskirts of the town, preferring
that position to elbowing his way through the busy crowd in the
middle of the fair.&nbsp; He did not appear anxious for a
customer, and munched his bread and cheese and onions with quiet
perseverance.&nbsp; Many persons, in passing by, gazed with
wonder at this piece of cloddish rusticity, and asked if the
horse was for sale; but receiving such drivelling and dolt-like
answers, that it became a matter of wonder who could have trusted
their property to such an oaf.</p>
<p>When Twm had stood some time, patiently bearing the ridicule
of many bystanders, who cracked jokes at his expense, a
gentlemen, well-mounted on a chestnut-coloured hunter, entered
the town, and cast an eager eye at the grey horse.&nbsp; Twm
recognized him at a glance as a Breconshire magistrate, named
Powell, one of the many rejected admirers of the lady of Ystrad
Feen.&nbsp; Riding up to our hero, he asked if the horse was for
sale.&nbsp; Twm answered in broken English, imitating the dialect
of the lower class, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t no but it <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>iss, if I
cann get somebody that is not wice, look you, somebody that was
fools to buy him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; asked the gentleman, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you take him into the horse-fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why inteed to goodness,&rdquo; answered Twm, &ldquo;I
was shame to take him there; for look you, he has a fault on him,
and I do not find in my heart and my conscience to take honest
people in with a horse that has a fault on him, for all master
did send me here to sell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what is this mighty fault?&rdquo; asked the
stranger, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why inteed to goodness and mercy,&rdquo; replied Twm,
&ldquo;it was a fault that do spoil him&mdash;it was a fault
that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the fault?&rdquo; asked the Breconshire
magistrate impatiently: &ldquo;give it a name, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why inteed to goodness,&rdquo; replied the scrupulous
horse-dealer, &ldquo;I will tell you like an honest christian
man, without more worts about it; I will make my sacrament and
bible oaths&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask your
oath,&rdquo; cried Powell, almost out of humour, &ldquo;merely
tell me in word, what ails the horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inteed and upon my soul and conscience to boot, I
can&rsquo;t say what do ail him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; cried Powell in an angry tone, and looking as
surprised and wrath as might be expected from a proud Breconian;
&ldquo;Confound me if I do,&rdquo; replied Twm, &ldquo;but I will
tell you why he was no good to master; it wass thiss&mdash;Master
iss a parson, a gentleman parson, not a poor curate, one mister
Inco Evans, rector of Tregaron, and the white hairs do come off
the grey horse here, and stick upon his best black coat and
preeches; and that was his fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a curious reason for disposing of so good-a-looking
animal as that Twm held by the bridle, and one that did not deter
Powell from buying him without further parley, and paying for him
there and then.&nbsp; He disappeared with his prize, wondering at
the stupid dolt from whom his purchase had been made.</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>Twm
retired now to a small public-house, where having asked for a
bed-room, he contrived, after making a total change in his garb,
to slip out again unperceived, not wishing, for various reasons,
to appear before his mistress <i>in propria
person&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; He now wore a grey sober suit, shining
black buckles, stockings of the wool of a black sheep, and a
knitted Welsh wig, of the same, that fitted him like a skullcap,
and concealed every lock of his hair.&nbsp; Thus arrayed, he
presented the appearance of a grave puritanical farmer, from the
remote district of Cardiganshire.</p>
<p>After gazing awhile at the motley crowd that constitutes a
fair, in a Welsh country town, he noticed a well-known crone, who
had the reputation of being exceedingly covetous.&nbsp; Lean,
yellow, and decrepid, her ferret-eyes glanced eagerly about for a
customer, as she held beneath her arm a large roil of stout
striped flannel.&nbsp; Twm, unobserved, took his stand behind
her, and dexterously stitching her bale to his coat, he, with a
sudden jerk, transferred it from the old woman&rsquo;s grasp to
his own.&nbsp; Her wonder and dismay was unutterable.</p>
<p>Elbowed and tossed about by the bustling crowd who were
passing to and fro, she knew not who to vent her spleen upon;
but, in utter despair, set up a tremendous howl, as a requiem for
her beloved departed.&nbsp; Instead of seeking the assistance of
a light pair of heels, Twm scarcely moved a yard, but drew from
his pocket a little black tobacco-pipe, and puffed a cloud with
admirable coolness, while his right arm lovingly embraced the
bale of flannel.</p>
<p>Roused by the old beldame&rsquo;s outrageous expressions of
grief and fury, he asked in a very pathetic tone, the cause of
her sorrow, which she related with many curses, sobs, and furious
exclamations.&nbsp; Shocked at her impiety, and want of
resignation, Twm took upon him to rebuke her, and edified her
much, by a discourse on the virtue of patience; assuring her she
ought to thank heaven that she was not a neglected <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>being.&nbsp; In conclusion, he remarked, that fairs and
markets in these degenerate days were so sadly infested with
rogues and vagabonds, that an honest person was completely
encompassed by dangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for my part,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;I never
enter such places without previously sewing my goods to my
clothes, which you ought also to have done, in this
manner.&rdquo;&mdash;showing at the same time, the roll beneath
his arm, which he thought the old crone&rsquo;s eyes had glanced
on, with something like a light of suspicion, that instantly
vanished, on this notable display and explanation.</p>
<p>Our hero&rsquo;s appetite only grew by what it fed upon, and
the taste of fun he had as yet been able to snatch only made him
wish for more.&nbsp; He did not wait long for an opportunity; it
was his habit to be so; he either met &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo;
half-way or entirely created his chance, making circumstances, in
a measure, contribute to his especial purposes.</p>
<p>Casting a sharp glance around, he saw making towards him, a
man of the cadaverous aspect, one who was an entire stranger to
substantial creature comforts, or, if not, one who &ldquo;shamed
his pasture&rdquo; considerably.</p>
<p>On closer scrutiny, Twm saw it was his old friend Moses, whose
hungry stomach had kept him hopelessly poor.&nbsp; Moses advanced
and tried to bargain for a few yards of his flannel; but on
reckoning his money found he could not come up to the price, as
he said he had to buy a three legged iron pot, in addition to a
winter petticoat for his wife: &ldquo;and,&rdquo; observed the
man of tatters, with a grin of miserable mirth, &ldquo;it will be
better for her to go without flannel than our whole family to
want a porridge pot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm liked Moses, but not his logic; which implied a want of
courtesy and due deference to his better half, whose indisputable
right to warm petticoats claimed precedence to all the pots,
pans, and every earthly consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here take this bale, take it all, for I have lost <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>my yard and
scissors, and pay me when you grow rich;&mdash;confound your
thanks! away with you, bestow it safe, then return here; perhaps
I may get thee an iron pot at as cheap a rate as the
flannel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moses did not want twice bidding to induce him to avail
himself of his good fortune, but entering into the spirit of the
scene at once, appeared to understand our hero&rsquo;s joking
propensities, although he had no suspicion that it was the
veritable Twm himself.&nbsp; Off Moses ran with his enormous
present, and immediately returned; when our hero accompanied him
to the shop of an old curmudgeon of an ironmonger, whose face,
hardly distinguishable behind his habitual screen of snuff and
spectacles, seemed of the same material as his own hardware.</p>
<p>The man of rags was quite in luck, and as instructed, followed
his benefactor into the shop in silence.&nbsp; Twm examined the
culinary ware, with all the caution of an old farm-wife, asking
the prices of various articles, and turned up the whites of his
eyes in the most approved puritanic fashion, expressive of
astonishment at such excessive charges.&nbsp; Old hammerhead
repelled the insinuation, and swore that cheaper or better pots
were never seen in the kitchen of a king.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you
must mean the king of the beggars,&rdquo; quoth Twm, &ldquo;for
you have nothing here but damaged ware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damaged devil! what do you mean?&rdquo; roared the
enraged ironmonger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; replied Twm Shon
Catty, with provoking equanimity, &ldquo;that there is scarcely a
pot here without a hole in it; now this which I hold in my hand
for instance, has one.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where! where!&rdquo;
asked the fiery old shop keeper, holding it up between his eyes
and the light: &ldquo;if there is a hole in this pot, I&rsquo;ll
eat it: where is the hole that you speak of?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; bawls the inexorable hoaxer, pulling it over
his ears, and holding it there, while Moses took the wink from
his patron, and walked off with a most choice article, which he
had selected from the whole lot.</p>
<p><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>Here
was a predicament for a respectable old tradesman!&nbsp; Our hero
fairly held his sides with laughter as the old curmudgeon
sprawled about, vainly endeavouring to free himself from the pot,
in which his terrible shouts for help were entirely lost.&nbsp;
Having tied his hands behind his back, Twm left him howling and
sweating beneath his huge extinguisher, and made as he took his
departure, this consolatory speech&mdash;&ldquo;Had there not
been a hole in it how could that large stupid knob of yours have
entered such a helmet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm left the enraged ironmonger to get out of his dilemma as
best he could, having very little sympathy with him in his
distress.&nbsp; When once more in the street, he found that the
people were all moving in one direction, and Twm discovered
shortly that there was some unusual attraction at the Town
Hall.&nbsp; As the assemblage increased, the way, like a choaked
mill-dam, became more and more impeded, until the whole restless
mass was consolidated, and stood still perforce.</p>
<p>Our hero had forced his way till near the entrance of the
hall, where he ventured to ask what cause had drawn together such
a crowd; but he got no immediate answer, as many came there, like
himself, drawn by the powerful influence of curiosity.</p>
<p>At length he heard his own name buzzed about; one said that
Twm Shon Catty whose humorous tricks were the themes of every
tongue, was discovered to be a great thief: and that he who had
fought against highwaymen, had at last become one himself, and
committed all the robberies which had taken place in that country
for years past.&nbsp; One said that he could never be taken; and
a third contradicted that assertion, declaring that he was then
fettered in the hall, and waiting to be conveyed to Carmarthen
gaol.&nbsp; One assigned him to the gallows as his due, while
another tenderly replied that hanging was too good for him.&nbsp;
Opposing the sentiments and opinions of all these, more than one
declared that the hemp was neither <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>spun nor grown that would hang Twm;
and pity it should, as he was a friend of the poor, and an enemy
to none but the stupid, the cruel, and the oppressive.</p>
<p>The disputed argument was disposed of summarily by the
appearance of an important functionary, resplendent in the
gorgeous dress which he wore in virtue of his exalted
office.&nbsp; This individual, who was the town crier, obtaining
silence, informed the assembled multitude that the magistrates
who were now sitting, required that any &ldquo;<i>person or
persons</i>&rdquo; who might have been defrauded in the fair,
should now come forward, so as to form a clue towards the
identity of the robber, which it was generally believed was no
other than the notorious Twm Shon Catty.&nbsp; The crier retired,
and in a few minutes re-appeared, and read the court&rsquo;s
proclamation, offering a reward of twenty pounds to any person
who would apprehend the said Twm Shon Catty; which was answered
with loud hisses by the majority of the crowd, and effectually
drowned the applause of the rest.</p>
<p>This was a most flattering ovation for Twm, and his spirits
rose accordingly; while, at the same time, he felt himself
aggrieved by this public proclamation concerning him by the
authorities, who, he considered, had, in this instance, somewhat
exceeded their vocation.&nbsp; He resolved to &ldquo;beard the
lion in his den,&rdquo; or in other words, to enter the hall and
give the lie to any base-minded cur who should dare to associate
his name with common robbers and felons.</p>
<p>Softly, Twm, softly, my boy!&nbsp; On second thoughts he came
to the conclusion that that would not be quite prudent&mdash;he
would make his way into the Hall of Justice, and preserving his
disguise, see how matters were progressing, and try if he could
not secure a little personal entertainment for himself.</p>
<p>Daring Twm! thy genius adapted itself to circumstances; many
people would be doubtless astonished that our hero should venture
on such cause, but when enthusiasm, and the pride of achievement,
even in a worthless cause, actuates the passion-fraught breast,
<a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>supplanting the place of reasoning calculation, the
wonder vanishes.&nbsp; The desperate outlaw, whose temerity is
applauded, feels the gust of heroism in as warm a degree as the
generous patriot whose claim to renown is better founded and
graced with national approbation.&nbsp; Twm soon found himself in
the hall; for it was his own native energies stood him in better
stead than the fabled cap of Fortunatus: he wished, and obtained;
hated, and was revenged; desired to tread a difficulty under
foot, and gained his purpose; while the generality of men would
be analyzing every shadow of obstruction that impeded their
aim.</p>
<p>He took his stand in a conspicuous place near the bench, the
&ldquo;awful judgment-seat,&rdquo; which was at this time filled
by three magistrates including his laughter-loving friend
Prothero, whose ruddy happy round face deprived law itself of
half its terrors.&nbsp; Before him, he found his old
<i>friend</i> Evans of Tregaron, who had been sputtering a
confused account of our hero&rsquo;s gracelessness from his
childhood, to the last trick he had played him, by stealing his
grey horse at Machynlleth.&nbsp; How he had cheated the heir of
Graspacre-Hall of the horse at Welshpool; and how the same horse
was traced into the possession of a simple fellow in straw boots
and cow-hide breeches, who that very day had sold it to his
friend Mr. Powell; which sale, he contended, could not stand
good, as the stolen horse was his property to all intents and
purposes, which he could prove by credible witnesses.</p>
<p>This recapitulation of Twm&rsquo;s tricks tickled the gravity
of Prothero amazingly; and at every pause which Evans made in his
narration, he was answered by the loud &ldquo;ho, ho, ho!&rdquo;
of that merry magistrate.</p>
<p>Mr. Powell then told his story, and, in conclusion, said he
was in the commission of the peace in the town of Brecon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; roared Prothero, &ldquo;here we are,
three magistrates, ho, ho, ho! three magistrates, and all fooled
by Twm Shon Catty.&mdash;Clever fellow, ho, ho, ho! wild dog, ho,
ho, ho!&mdash;means no great harm&mdash;never keeps what he
steals&mdash;gives all to the poor <a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>fellows that want&mdash;ho, ho,
ho!&nbsp; Never mind, gentlemen, the fun of the thing repays the
loss, which can be shared between you.&nbsp; Let Mr. Evans take
the horse, on paying Mr. Powell what he gave young cow-breeches,
ho, ho, ho! better than lose all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Powell immediately acceded to the arrangement, but the
unaccommodating Evans insisted on having the horse without the
payment, and made some tart remarks on conniving at a
rascal&rsquo;s tricks and villanies.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my part,
I&rsquo;d shoot him dead like a dog!&rdquo; cried the reverend
preacher of peace and concord; drawing at the same time, a pair
of pistols from his pocket, and replacing them, in a fiery fit of
passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; roared Prothero,
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;d catch him first, brother, ho, ho,
ho!&mdash;too cunning for you, for me, and all of us&mdash;might
be here this moment, laughing in his sleeve at us, for what we
know, ho, ho, ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm thought it was now time to be taking a more active part in
the scene, so taking out a small book, while appearing to be
deeply absorbed in its perusal, he gave a deep groan as if much
moved by what he read, and the mourning sound at once attracted
notice.</p>
<p>Prothero, alive to everything allied to comicality, burst out
into a loud ho, ho, ho!&nbsp; Evans arrayed his naturally gloomy
brows in a magisterial frown, and Powell smiled, with an
expression of wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you reading,
friend?&rdquo; asked Prothero, chuckling as he surveyed the black
Welsh wig.&nbsp; &ldquo;The wisdom of Solomon,&rdquo; quoth the
man of solemnity, drawing the muscles of his face most
ludicrously long; &ldquo;but mark you, worshipful gentlemen, I
mean not the Solomon of the scriptures, but our own Cambrian
Solomon&mdash;that is to say, Catwg the Wise, the excellent and
erudite abbot of Llancarvan, and teacher of the Bard
Taliesin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right enough.&nbsp; Catwg was
doubtless a clever man, but why do you bring him here?&rdquo;
enquired Prothero, with a broad smile on his face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherever I go, I have resolved to make his wisdom known,
and <a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>to
reprove all deviators from it, in the sage&rsquo;s own
words,&rdquo; quoth Twm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor man, poor man,
he&rsquo;s crazy, his brain turned, perhaps by too much
study,&rdquo; observed Prothero.&nbsp; &ldquo;An impudent
fellow!&rdquo; cried Evans; &ldquo;but you are strangely lenient
here in Carmarthenshire; were I the king, I would have such
fellows put in Bedlam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm looked at the clerical magistrate, then read from the
book, &ldquo;If a crown were worn by every fool, we should all of
us be kings.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentlemen, he calls us all
fools!&rdquo; cried Evans.&nbsp; Twm, without raising his eyes
from the book, read on, &ldquo;were there horns on the head of
every fool, a good sum might be gained by showing a bald
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentlemen, he makes us all
cuckolds!&rdquo; cried Evans, in his usual sputter;
&ldquo;however it may fit you, gentlemen, I can safely say, that
no disgrace as a horn belongs to my brow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm read on:&mdash;&ldquo;If the shame of every one were
written on his forehead, the materials for masks would be
surprisingly dear.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo; roared
Prothero, till the hall echoed with his loud laughter, which the
Cardiganshire magistrate seemed to take as a personal affront,
and sulkily observed, that this was no place for foolery, but for
gravity, wisdom, and truth.</p>
<p>Twm read on:&mdash;&ldquo;If no tongue were to speak other
than truth and wisdom, the number of mutes would be astonishingly
great.&rdquo;&nbsp; The consequential Inco, mumbled something
about his own mode of doing business at Cardigan, and declared
that he would commit such a fellow to gaol for three months, at
least, for disturbing a court of justice.&nbsp; Twm cut him short
with another passage from Catwg:&mdash;&ldquo;Were the talkative
to perceive the folly of his chattering, he would save his breath
to cool his broth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Powell of Brecon entered a little into the spirit of the
scene, by quoting also from the well-known aphorisms of Catwg,
applying the passage to Twm himself;&mdash;&ldquo;If the buffoon
were to see the vanity of his feat, he would leave it off for
shame.&rdquo;&nbsp; This feeble hit excited the applause of the
good-humoured <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>Prothero, who clapped the speaker heartily on the back,
and, amid his eternal ho, ho, ho! exclaimed, &ldquo;Well said,
brother, well said; better silence him with wit than by
authority; well done, well done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm was not slow in taking up the gauntlet which the
Breconshire magistrate had thrown at his feet, and so turning
pointedly to him, he read;&mdash;&ldquo;If the lover were to see
his weakness, terror would drive him to a premature
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; A general laugh at the expense of Powell,
instantly followed.&nbsp; To him that passage was considered
peculiarly applicable, as the unsuccessful woer of the gay widow
of Ystrad Feen.&nbsp; It was a tender string to touch so
roughly.&nbsp; Losing his ease and temper at the same instant, he
cast a most ungracious frown at the utterer of proverbs, and said
in an undertone of threatening energy, &ldquo;Whoever you may be,
it were not wise of you to repeat such conduct towards me
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Again?&rdquo; said Twm, pretending to
misunderstand him, &ldquo;Oh, certainly, I&rsquo;ll give you the
passage again, or any other, to you; &lsquo;If the
lover&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo; here Powell&rsquo;s face blazed with
anger, as he clenched his fist, and cried, &ldquo;You had better
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm began again,&mdash;&ldquo;If the lover&mdash;of war, were
to see his cruelty, he would fear that every atom in the sunbeam
might stab him as a sword.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dexterous evasion,
with the point given to the words &ldquo;of war,&rdquo; had its
full effect in restoring the good humour, so suddenly disturbed;
but that beautiful passage from the aphorisms of the old Welsh
abbot failed to elicit the applause which its moral merits
deserve.</p>
<p>At this moment the attention of all present was attracted by
the noisy entrance of the ex-proprietress of the flannel, who
almost deafened them by the vehemence of her complaints; which,
however, were too incoherently expressed to be immediately
understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my roll of flannel, my fine, my excellent flannel!
all of my own spinning too,&mdash;eight and twenty good yards,
and a yard and a half wide&mdash;my wooden <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>shoe too,
that I lost in the crowd&mdash;and my poor corns trod off by the
villains&mdash;my dear sweet flannel, all of my own carding and
spinning&mdash;nobody but the devil himself, or his first cousin
Twm Shon Catty, could have taken it in such a manner&mdash;it was
whisked from me as if a whirlwind had swept it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length she paused for want of breath, and Twm approached
her with the air of a comforter, and read from his
book,&mdash;&ldquo;Were a woman as quick with her feet as with
her tongue, she would catch the lightning to kindle her fire in
the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is probable that she did not
perfectly hear this passage, as on perceiving Twm, she gave a
shout of joy, and then as incoherently as before, appealed to the
magistrate; &ldquo;This honest man, your worship, knows it
all.&nbsp; I told him, the moment I lost my flannel&mdash;this
worthy man, your worship&mdash;a good man, a man who reads books,
your worship, he can witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This vehement outburst of eloquence was brought to a sudden
termination, and the old woman&rsquo;s wordy complaint
effectually strangled by the laughter and applause which greeted
the appearance of a more ridiculous applicant for justice and his
right.</p>
<p>Supported by two constables, who rather dragged forward, than
led him, came Twm&rsquo;s friend the hardwareman, crowned with
the identical iron pot before named, which the officers, as a
matter of official formality, or to indulge their own
facetiousness, refused to remove, till in the presence of a
magistrate.&nbsp; When his laughter had a little subsided,
Prothero ordered the pot to be removed, and his hands
untied.&nbsp; The hardwareman then told his lamentable tale in a
few words; in conclusion, he declared, that having overheard
certain words between the robber and his accomplice, he had
learned that the thief was no other than Twm Shon Catty.&nbsp;
His eye now caught on the figure of our hero, and with a yell as
astounding as if the eternal enemy of man stood before him, he
cried, &ldquo;There he is! there he is!&nbsp; As heaven shall
save me, there stands the man, or devil, who crowned me with <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>the iron
pot, while his accomplice ran off with the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who robbed me of my flannel!&rdquo; roared the old
woman, who now changed her opinion, as her earliest suspicions
became thus suddenly confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who stole my grey horse!&rdquo; bawled Evans of
Tregaron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who sold it to me when disguised in straw boots and
cow-hide breeches!&rdquo; cried Powell of Brecon, who had now
closely examined his features.</p>
<p>Things looked desperate as far as Twm was concerned, as an
attack was now made upon him by three or four of his most
determined enemies; but Twm eluding their eager attempts to grasp
him, sprang upon the table before the bench, and drawing a couple
of pistols from his coat pockets, held one in each hand, and kept
them all at bay, protesting he would shoot the first who would
advance an inch towards him.&nbsp; Loud was his laughter when
they all started back: but Prothero, now sat silently on the
bench, alarmed for his safety, which he had thought to secure by
giving him warning of his danger, in the feint of his proclaimed
reward for his apprehension.</p>
<p>As he stood in this manner, with extended arms, watchful eyes,
and grasping the pointed pistols with a finger to each trigger,
Powell of Brecon exclaimed, &ldquo;Thou art a clever fellow, by
Jove, Twm! very clever for a Cardy; but wert thou with us, the
quick-witted sons of Brecon, thou wouldst soon find thyself
overmatched.&nbsp; I dare thee to enter Brecon, to trust to thy
cunning&mdash;come there, and welcome, and thou shalt stand
harmless of me, in the affair of the grey horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twm
smiled, and nodded, in token of having accepted his
challenge.</p>
<p>Rather daunted by the failure of their first attempt to seize
Twm, his assailants had held back awed by his resolute and
defiant attitude, but recovering their courage on reflecting upon
the odds against him, they now, headed by Evans of Tregaron, got
behind him, and clung to his right arm, but with one <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>violent
effort Twm shook them away, as the mighty bull throws off the
yelping curs that dare to attack him.&nbsp; Then, with a single
leap, he sprang from the table into the crowded court, where a
lane was formed for him, and rushed out of the door unimpeded,
and pursued by his accusers.&nbsp; They soon lost sight of him
among the moving multitude, some of whom dispersed from fear of
accidents, while others followed him as spectators.</p>
<p>To the great astonishment of his pursuers they next caught a
view of him mounted on that grand subject of contention, the grey
horse.&nbsp; He took the route of Ystrad Feen, followed by
several constables in the employ of Evans of Tregaron, and many
disinterested persons from the fair.&nbsp; Loud were the shouts
of the numerous riders; loud the tramp of galloping horses; and
wild the disorder and terror created, as Twm at different
intervals turned on his pursuers, and fired his pistols.&nbsp;
This caused a powerful retrograde movement among them, by which
the foremost horses fell back to those behind them, unhorsing
some who lay groaning and crying with fright on the ground, and
frightening others altogether from the pursuit.</p>
<p>It was on this occasion that a bard of that day wrote the
stanza which appears on the title page, thus translated by the
late Iolo Morganwg:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Ystrad Feen a doleful sound<br />
Pervades the hollow hills around;<br />
The very stones with terror melt,<br />
Such fear of Twn Shon Catty felt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fortune still favoured Twm, who reaching the foot of Dinas
somewhat in advance of his motley train of pursuers, dismounted,
sprung from stone to stone, that formed the ford of the Tower,
and climbed the steep side of that majestic mount, with the
utmost ease.&nbsp; Like a prudent sea-captain, Twm was chased in
his small boat by a fleet of rovers, till he reaches his own
war-ship, and springs up her fort-like side, <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>and treads
his deck in the ecstasy of surmounted peril, conscious strength,
and superiority.</p>
<p>Thus Twm now attained the summit of a prominent knoll, and
waved his hand triumphantly, in defiance of his foes below.&nbsp;
Evans of Tregaron, with his crew of catchpoles, made an attempt
to climb also; Twm permitted them to advance about twenty yards
above the river, when he ended the warfare, by rolling down
several huge stones, that swept them in a mass into the bed of
the river Towey, sadly bruised, but more frightened, from whence
they were extricated by the amazed and terrified spectators.</p>
<p>Evans of Tregaron met with an accident, which during the
remainder of his life reminded him of his hasty chase after Twm
Shon Catty.&nbsp; In starting aside to avoid the dreadful leaping
crags that threatened to crush him, his pistols went off in his
pockets, and carried away, besides his coat skirts and the rear
of his black breaches, a large portion of postern flesh, that
deprived him forever after of that agreeable cushion which nature
had provided.</p>
<p>Amusing to the population of Tregaron was the singular sight
of their crest-fallen magistrate and his hated gang, brought home
in woeful plight, as inside passenger of a dung-cart, which had
been hired for the purpose; and more than all, that his
discomfiture should have been caused by their long-lost
countryman Twm Shon Catty.</p>
<p>Our hero was clearly in an unassailable position, and his
enemies were not so stupid as to be entirely blind to that
important fact.&nbsp; So, like a princely chieftain of the days
of old, enthroned upon his native tower of strength, marking in
his soul&rsquo;s high pride the awkward predicament of his
baffled foes, perceiving them all depart; leaving him the
undisputed lord of his alpine territory, the glorious height of
Dinas.</p>
<p>After witnessing, with his limbs stretched upon his mountain
couch, the glorious beauty of the setting <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>sun, he
entered the cave, tore from its top a sufficiency of fern and
heather to form his bed, threw on it his fatigued, over-exerted
frame, and slept soundly until morning.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Twm</span> at
Brecon.&nbsp; An angling feat.&nbsp; Twm in a musical
character.&nbsp; Wins the prize offered for a poem.&nbsp; A new
style of marriage&mdash;and some other little &ldquo;odds and
ends.&rdquo;&nbsp; Conclusion.</p>
<p>With the earliest rays of the morning&rsquo;s sun Twm was
astir, and during a long ramble on the hills, was busily turning
over in his mind the exciting-incidents of the previous
day.&nbsp; Unable to account for his second disappointment of
seeing his mistress, according to promise, he gave way to
despondency, and conjectured the worst&mdash;that she was no
longer true to his vows, but had yielded to the persuasions of
her haughty relative, and become a renegade both to love and to
honour.&nbsp; He was now, however, so near her residence, he
would at least ascertain how matters stood; and, after many
efforts of resolution, he descended the hill for that
purpose.</p>
<p>On crossing the Towey, he was surprised to find that the
&ldquo;gallant grey&rdquo; was still left for him; he was busily
feeding in an adjoining field, and the saddle and bridle hung
dangling from a storm-stricken old thorn.&nbsp; He felt this,
directly, as a handsome piece of attention to him, on the part of
Powell of Brecon, who, doubtless, had left it there for
convenience.</p>
<p>On examining further, he found a note, tied to the bridle,
from that generous individual, inviting him to be present at the
Eisteddvod, the Races and the Ball, which were to take place
successively in the gay town of Brecon.</p>
<p><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>He
was doomed to disappointment; for on reaching Ystrad Feen he
found nobody but the servants, who informed him that their lady,
Miss Meredith, and the late visitors, were all gone to Brecon,
and would not return for some days.&nbsp; This intelligence
determined him to go there also; and recollecting a trunk of
clothes of his, which had been left ever since his sojourning
there, he called for it; and having dressed himself, and placed
with other things, in his saddle-bags, an elegant suit which he
had brought from London, he mounted his horse, and rode off for
Brecon.</p>
<p>About a couple of miles beyond Trecastle, he overtook a poor
fellow driving an ass, laden with coarse crockery ware, who
turned out to be no other than Ready Rosser.&nbsp; Having long
been married to a Cardiganshire lass, they both, pretending to be
single, entered Squire Prothero&rsquo;s service at the same time;
but the circumstance being at length discovered, they were both
discharged a few days since, and now commenced the crockery
business for a livelihood.&nbsp; After a few jests on the white
bull, ox, and sheep, Twm spurred on, but not before he had
purchased the whole of Rosser&rsquo;s stock, which, however, that
worthy was to take to Brecon, for a purpose to be hereafter
described.</p>
<p>At Brecon he took lodgings at the Three Cocks&rsquo; inn, to
which he gave a preference, on account of the sign being the
armorial bearings of the celebrated David Gam,
(Shakespeare&rsquo;s Captain Fuellin,) the hero of Agincourt.</p>
<p>Crowds still poured into the town from all points of the
compass, until it seemed impossible that the streets would hold
them.&nbsp; While our hero looked through the window to observe
Rosser, who arranged his crockery in front of the inn, his
attention was suddenly caught by the sound of a harp, which
proceeded from the kitchen.&nbsp; To his great surprise, he found
the performer to be his old friend the venerable Ianto Gwyn of
Tregaron.</p>
<p>The old man was very glad to see him, and after learning the
particulars of the fortunes he had met since <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>he left his
native town, proceeded to inform him of the Tregaron news.&nbsp;
His mother was well three weeks ago, and had received the various
sums which he had sent her at different times, and was in daily
hopes of burying her churl of a husband.&nbsp; Rachael Ketch was
now dead; having broken her heart for the loss of her money,
which had been stolen by Watt the mole-catcher, who was
transported.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the old man said that he had come to the
Eisteddvod rather as a spectator than a candidate for the prize,
having accidentally hurt his right hand, which nearly disabled
him altogether from playing.&nbsp; &ldquo;That circumstance is
now the more provoking,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;as I am
convinced that were my hand well, I should certainly win the
noble silver harp, which is to be the meed of the best
player.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm took his musical friend upstairs, and, after dining
together, began coquetting with the harp, which with the hand of
a ready player, he soon tinkled into alternate fits of grief and
laughter, as he ran over many of our most popular airs.</p>
<p>The old man jumped up from his seat, and embraced him with
rapture, protesting that he could not fail to win the harp, if he
chose to be a candidate.&nbsp; Our hero, having practised but
little on the harp since he left London, felt considerable
diffidence in becoming a competitor among proficients in music,
but resolved, at any rate to avail himself of the instructions of
his friend Ianto Gwyn.</p>
<p>Intensely anxious to meet his mistress once more, he sought an
early opportunity of a walk through the streets; but instead of
the desired one, it was his lot to meet Powell the magistrate,
who gave him a jocular and right hearty welcome.&nbsp; They were
soon joined by two other high bloods of the town, one a wealthy
attorney, named Phillips, and the other a reverend and
right-portly son of the church, who shone more at the punch-bowl
than in the pulpit.&nbsp; They all adjourned to the parlour of
the Three Cocks, where the best of <a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>wine was soon in request, and a gay
scene of conviviality and good fellowship ensued.</p>
<p>Twm&rsquo;s fame had of course preceded him, for
Powell&rsquo;s tongue had been busy in his praise, although he
had done him no more than justice, and those four worthies soon
understanding each other, they spent a pretty jolly time of
it.&nbsp; Being all lads of the turf, the practice of betting was
familiar to them; and the lawyer offered to oppose Twm in a match
of angling for five pounds; and the bet should be, that
&ldquo;<i>whoever fished the largest weight</i>, <i>no matter of
what kind</i>, <i>in half an hour</i>, <i>should be declared the
winner</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our hero, although a poor angler,
accepted the wager, and Powell, as the umpire, wrote down the
terms of it, which was signed by each.</p>
<p>Possessing himself of angling paraphernalia, he repaired with
them to the bridge, and had the upper side of it assigned to him,
while Phillips had the lower.&nbsp; The latter displayed a grand
morocco pocket-book, filled in the neatest order with the most
choice artificial flies, of every description, and soon had his
handsome rod in order; while the former had nothing better than
what could be procured at a shop.&nbsp; The lawyer landed fish
after fish, with great rapidity, and when half the given time had
expired, Twm found himself much in arrears, and the continued
good fortune of his antagonist left him, apparently, no chance of
ultimate success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound these good-for-nothing flies! fetch me a beef
steak!&rdquo; cried he at last, and gave money for that purpose
to a by-stander, who immediately brought the article wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Cardy angler, fishing for trout with a
beef steak!&rdquo; cried the Breconians, with an exulting
laugh.&nbsp; Twm made no reply, but fastened several hooks in
different parts of a strong line, to each of which he attached a
small piece of beef; and, watching the movement of a flock of
ducks that floated in luxurious ease down the Usk, he threw the
whole among them.</p>
<p>Loud was the clamour of the aquatic crew, as they <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>hustled
each other, in their eagerness to partake of the showered feast,
which they soon gobbled, and were drawn up to the top of the
bridge by the singular angler above, amid the shouts of laughter
of the numerous spectators.</p>
<p>This feat was greeted by the by-standers with shouts of
derision, as they thought that Twm, in thus trifling, had
practically confessed his inability to win the wager.&nbsp;
Powell called time, saying that the half hour had struck.&nbsp;
Phillips, as the conscious winner, produced a goodly show of
trout, and, as Twm had caught but four small fish, said it would
be idle to weigh them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; replied our wag, &ldquo;let the written
terms of the bet be read, and you will find that my ducks have a
right to be weighed against your boasted trout, aye! and shall
make them kick the beam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phillips started at such an assertion made in earnest, and
Powell read, &ldquo;Whoever fished the largest weight, no matter
of what kind, would be declared the winner,&rdquo; and as umpire,
awarded the five pounds to our hero.</p>
<p>Some merriment at the expense of Powell was caused by his
declaring himself the unlucky proprietor of the said flock of
ducks; but with his usual good-humour, he proposed that the ducks
and the trout should be cooked at his house for their supper, in
which Phillips acquiesced.</p>
<p>After dinner, when the bottle had passed pretty freely, and
all were prepared for any fun which might fall in their way, our
hero contrived to bring Powell, who had hitherto fought shy, into
a bet with him.&nbsp; He declared that a stranger as he was to
Brecon, he firmly believed that he could command, and be obeyed
there, with greater promptitude than himself, although a justice
of the peace and one of the quorum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay you twenty pounds to the
contrary,&rdquo; cried the magistrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; replied Twm, &ldquo;and we can prove it
without <a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>quitting this room, by opening the window, and
practising on some of those people opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be yon crockery-wareman, who is the most
conspicuous,&rdquo; said Powell, and Twm, of course, could have
no possible objection.</p>
<p>The magistrate opened the window, and called in a tone of
authority, &ldquo;Come here, you fellow; go directly to the Black
Lion, and tell the landlord to let you have Justice
Powell&rsquo;s black mare, and bring her here to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quit my goods, sir,&rdquo; said Rosser,
&ldquo;or I would willingly oblige you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, fellow, do as I order you, or I shall kick
you and your ware out of the town,&rdquo; said Powell in a
blustering tone, and with a look the most terrifying that he
could assume.</p>
<p>Rosser repeated his former answer; and when the magistrate
increased his threats, he burst out into a rude laugh, and,
without further difference, said he really believed that his
worship was drunk: this was enough, and the worthy magistrate
felt himself completely put down.</p>
<p>Our wag now took his turn, and commenced with him: &ldquo;I
say, fellow, did&rsquo;st thou ever see or hear of Twm Shon
Catty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Rosser, &ldquo;often at Llandovery;
once at Cardigan; and now I see him before me at
Brecon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; continued Twm, &ldquo;I order thee to
give us a dance in the middle of the crockery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart, if <i>you</i> order it, for I should
dread to disobey Twm Shon Catty more than twenty times my
loss.&rdquo;&nbsp; On which he jumped, capered and danced, in the
midst of his brittle commodities, kicking and treading the
dishes, pans, basins, and other articles, to powder beneath his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Lord, thou art a strange fellow!&rdquo; said
Powell, as he paid him the amount of his forfeit; &ldquo;and I
foresee that there&rsquo;s much more luck for thee than thou
dreamest of: and I confidently anticipate what will come in thy
favour, my Cardiganian hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>Twm
was much surprised to hear Powell speak thus, as his manner
implied much more than his words; but his astonishment was
considerably augmented when, in a subsequent conversation, our
hero discovered that Powell knew all his affairs and connections
with the lady of Ystrad Feen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She once,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;played me a
jade&rsquo;s trick; but no matter, we are now friends, and she
has even assisted me in my suit with her amiable friend, Miss
Meredith.&nbsp; In heart and soul, she is attached to you, Jones;
but she is a weak yielding woman beneath the terrors of her
father&rsquo;s frown, and in some evil hour might again sacrifice
herself, if you are too long out of her sight.&nbsp; She is proud
of you and of your wild achievements, and even finds excuses for
your most blameable courses.&nbsp; Now, my advice is, that you
will endeavour to distinguish yourself during the races, and
start for the gold plate: the grey horse, I suspect, has blood in
him, and will beat the best that is to run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; asked Twm, &ldquo;did she not keep her
promise to meet me at Llandovery fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Powell replied that she was prevented by her father&rsquo;s
sudden illness; and great is her sorrow for the disappointment
she must have caused.</p>
<p>On the following day the town speedily put on its gala
dresses, and flags waved from every corner.&nbsp; Bells were rung
and guns fired in honour of the festival, which consisted of a
rather extensive programme, namely the Eisteddvod, Races, and
Ball.&nbsp; Between eleven and twelve o&rsquo;clock, our hero,
with other musical and literary competitors, entered the
Town-Hall, in bardic trim, with the harp of his friend Ianto
Gwyn, slung by a blue ribbon, and attached to his shoulder.</p>
<p>The audience included all the intellect, taste, and fashion of
the district, and the competitors were greeted on their
appearance, with hearty and long-continued applause.</p>
<p>At length the business of the meeting was begun by a speech
from the president, who occupied a central seat on the raised
platform.&nbsp; He dwelt emphatically <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>on the laudable object of the
Eisteddvod; &ldquo;to preserve from annihilation one of the most
ancient languages spoken by mankind, remarkable for its
perspicuousness, energy, and expression; that, like a perpetual
living miracle, kept its firm stand in this solitary nook of
country;&mdash;to revive and preserve the beautiful melodies
which had been the delight of our gallant and patriotic
forefathers;&mdash;and lastly by emulation, to keep alive the
brilliant blaze of the native Awen, the darling poesy of the
land, which yielded their fragrant and refreshing blossoms,
lovely sacrifice on the altar of Taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penillion singing succeeded; in which the minstrels of
Merionethshire excelled.&nbsp; The rest went on in rotation,
minutely according to the description given by the ever-faithful
Drayton, to whose pages we refer the reader.</p>
<p>There was a surprise awaiting Twm.&nbsp; Among the given
subjects for the Cowydd, or Poem, was &ldquo;Govid,&rdquo; or
Affliction, for which it turned out that there was but one who
had written on it; and, to his unutterable astonishment, he heard
his own poem on that title recited, and more than all, a prize
awarded to it by the umpires.</p>
<p>Lady Devereaux, who had attached her name to this effusion,
was called upon to receive the meed of her talents.&nbsp; That
lady, who sat by her father, as one of the audience, now rose,
and said, with some emotion, that the poem so highly honoured was
not of her composition, but had been sent to her by its author, a
person of taste and ingenuity, whom she was bound ever to esteem;
as to his valour and courtesy she had once been indebted for the
preservation of her life.&nbsp; Then naming Mr. Thomas Jones as
the author, she pointed him out; and, amid loud and long
applause, a handsome silver medal was placed round his neck.</p>
<p>We will not occupy more space in relating what the reader can
so readily imagine.&nbsp; Our hero was the most successful
competitor at the Eisteddvod, and at the <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>Races.&nbsp; At the Ball too he won the admiration of
the ladies, and withal, the wonder and esteem of the
Breconians.&nbsp; But alas! the buoyancy of spirits, and the
exultation of heart, which owed their evanescent existence to
these distinction, were soon doomed to give way to feelings of
contrasted severity.</p>
<p>Now, while in the zenith of his glory, confidently
anticipating, as the final crown of his happiness, the willing
hand of his mistress, a note for him arrived at the inn, from the
fair widow, that threw him into absolute despair.&nbsp; She told
him in plain terms, that unless he could outwit her, all his
hopes of her hand would be utterly in vain.&nbsp; This intimation
he could understand only as a formal <i>permit</i> to wear the
willow as soon as he pleased; that she was otherwise engaged, and
had altogether done with him.</p>
<p>His reasoning and conclusions in this argument received
absolute and entire confirmation by the tantalising conduct of
Miss Meredith, who accidentally meeting him one day, did nothing
but laugh and jest at his anxious-looking face and restless
behaviour.&nbsp; She would give no answers to his eager,
importunate questioning, and ran away and left him, half wild and
desperate.&nbsp; The next hour, at least, was spent by Twm in
railing bitterly the &ldquo;vile caprice and inconsistency of
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing that her company had preceded her in the way home,
next evening, and that she was about to follow them alone, he
resolved to way-lay and put her under contribution, at any rate;
which he conceived would be one way, at least, of out-witting
her, and perhaps the right one.</p>
<p>He hastily assumed a dress which thoroughly disguised him, for
his features were almost altogether concealed by a large hairy
travelling cap, which he wore well down over his ears, and his
figure was equally lost amongst the ample folds of a great coat,
which had never been made for him.</p>
<p>His preparations made, he took his stand by the gate <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>that in
those days led from the town into the mountains, through which
the road ran to Llanspyddyd, Trecastle, and Llandovery.</p>
<p>At length the gay widow arrived, and Twm immediately caught
hold of her bridle, and, in an assumed snuffling tone of voice,
demanded her money.&nbsp; She begged hard for mercy on her
pocket, but in vain; and gave at last a considerable sum, which,
she said, was the whole contents of her pocket.&nbsp; Our hero,
having placed the booty in the crown of his cap, declared himself
quite satisfied; &ldquo;And so am I!&rdquo; cried the spirited
widow; and, at the same moment, grasping his cap and its whole
contents, laughing aloud as she galloped away from him, she
cried, &ldquo;Thus the widow outwits and triumphs over Twm Shon
Catty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Fortune determined to spite poor Twm Shon Catty as much as
she had previously favoured him?&nbsp; It looked most
unpleasantly like; for he had never been in such a deplorable
condition as now, standing there in the road, glancing wistfully
at the fast retreating figure of the widow.&nbsp; He was shorn of
his laurels completely, and at once a bankrupt in love and
fortune; as the cap contained the whole of the money he brought
with him to Brecon, as well as what he had gained there.</p>
<p>This inauspicious adventure, although it damped his spirits
for a time, had the ultimate effect of rousing his latent
energies to the highest pitch.&nbsp; He was not long in hatching
a scheme to forward his purposes, which, however, required the
aid (which was soon offered to him) of Powell and his two
friends.</p>
<p>Twelve o&rsquo;clock the next morning saw him dismounting at
the door of Ystrad Feen, accoutred in a military undress;
originally used by him in London, as at present, for masquerading
purposes.&nbsp; In this disguise, he expected immediate
admittance as a stranger; but to his unutterable dismay, instead
of finding the door fly open to his knock, it appeared to have
been doubly barricaded against him.</p>
<p>After his repeated summons, the lady of the mansion, <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>with
pompous formality, appeared at the window, like the warder of a
fortress holding a parley at the outpost.&nbsp; In a gay spirit
of bantering, she declared that the military uniform became him
exceedingly, and begged to know what rank he held in the
army.&nbsp; Our hero parried these home-thrusts but with an
ordinary degree of grace, and, in a bowed spirit, entreated
admission to the inner walls.&nbsp; The lady Joan was quite
peremptory in her refusal, declaring, that having lately heard so
much to his disadvantage, she had decided on breaking off all
future acquaintance with him as a lover;
&ldquo;especially,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;as, instead of the
witty person I thought you, I find you quite a dull animal, that
any school-girl might outwit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she indulged in a provoking laugh, and bade him
&ldquo;good bye,&rdquo; as she turned to close the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay then,&rdquo; said Twm in a desponding key,
&ldquo;if we are indeed to be henceforth strangers, as we have
been friends, true and warm friends, you will give me your hand,
at least, in parting.&rdquo;&nbsp; She slowly stretched out her
hand through the window, and our hero, with the eager spring of a
hungry tiger, darted forward, grasped her wrist with his left
hand, and drawing his sword with the right, exclaimed in a tone
of affected fury, &ldquo;Revenge at least is left me&mdash;by yon
blessed sky above us, I&rsquo;ll be trifled with no
longer&mdash;off goes your hand unless you consent to our union
this instant, and on this very spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! don&rsquo;t squeeze so hard and look so
fierce,&rdquo; cried the lady of Ystrad Feen.</p>
<p>Twm, with increased boisterousness, resumed, &ldquo;On your
answer will depend, whether, for the remainder of your life, you
have a single hand or a pair of them&mdash;for on the pronouncing
of a negative, this hand, this soft white hand, beautiful as it
is, will instantly fly, severed from the wrist; and only think
now, my gentle lady Joan, how dreadful you would look with a
stump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twm looked determined enough, and what could a lady do in
respectable society with only one hand?&nbsp; The idea was
preposterous.&nbsp; In her vexation, she <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>stretched
her pretty neck out, and endeavoured to make her tormentor relax
his grasp by inflicting a bite on the back of his hand.&nbsp; Twm
seized this opportunity of imprinting a very decisive kiss on her
check, on which she drew back her head, her face glowing
radiantly with blushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You villain!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;I suspected you
were about to bite my ear off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only your hand, Joan,&rdquo; replied Twm;
&ldquo;and that I <i>will</i> have, unless you consent to be mine
this instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not so much care,&rdquo; cried the lady of
Ystrad Feen, &ldquo;but your horrid name; I could not endure to
be called Mrs. Twm Shon Catty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have protested bitterly, and will not be
foresworn,&rdquo; cried Twm, &ldquo;that here, even here, with
your hand stretched through the window, the marriage ceremony
shall be performed; and so your answer at once without
evasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parson of our parish has gone to a
christening,&rdquo; said the lady of Ystrad Feen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes or no!&rdquo; roared the terrific Twm, menacing the
threatened blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, as I could not handle a knife or fork, or
play my spinnet, or give you a box on the ear when I want
pastime, I may as well say&mdash;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless thee for that,&rdquo; cried Twm in ecstacy, and
eagerly kissed the captured hand.&nbsp; Sticking his sword in the
ground, he drew forth a small bugle, and blew a loud blast that
was re-echoed by the surrounding mountains.&nbsp; Immediately a
party of ten persons, wearing masks, appeared, one of which was
arrayed in a clerical habit, who drawing forth his book, at once
commenced the marriage ceremony, Twm the while holding her hand
through the window.</p>
<p>The Lady of Ystrad Feen had never calculated upon being
married in this unceremonious fashion; but she was fairly at a
loss, and therefore came to the conclusion to endure her fate,
patiently and with resignation, yet in her heart very glad that
<a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>she was
under such a pleasant pressure of circumstances.</p>
<p>The ceremonial was nearly half over, when four windows of the
first floor were suddenly opened, and several highly-dressed
ladies and gentlemen put out their heads and displayed most
mirthful countenances, the fair ones waving their whitest
cambrics above their heads; and with shaking peals of laughter,
looked down upon this singular wedding.&nbsp; The &ldquo;ho, ho,
ho!&rdquo; of the merry Prothero, was heard with surpassing
loudness; and &ldquo;Well done, Twm!&rdquo; were the first words
that the spirit of titillation permitted him to utter.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this interruption, the ceremony was finished,
and parson Hughes pronounced them man and wife.&nbsp; Unwilling
to loosen the hand which he now considered his own, our hero held
it fast till he entered the house through the window.</p>
<p>Once within the mansion that now called him master, an amazing
change of circumstances took place.&nbsp; The lady endearingly
asked for forgiveness for her latter conduct, while Twm entreated
the same for himself.&nbsp; Squire Prothero had been the author
of many good offices for our hero; having conciliated Sir John
Price, who, although a proud man, was also something of a
humorist, as he proved himself in this instance.&nbsp; A plan was
concerted to throw every impediment in the way of Twm&rsquo;s
union, for him to surmount them as he could, to afford sport for
the old baronet and his merry friend Prothero, in which trickery
the lady herself was by promise compelled to join, which accounts
for her latter conduct.</p>
<p>Being ushered by his bride into the drawing-room, our hero was
introduced to, and warmly greeted by two most unexpected
personages, his lady&rsquo;s father and his own!&nbsp; Sir John,
who had been a visitor at the Priory-House for a week, was the
gayest of the gay on this occasion.&nbsp; Placing an elegant
tiara of jewels on her brow, the northern Baronet embraced her
tenderly; and handing her to our hero, said, <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>&ldquo;Here, you lucky dog! prove thyself worthy of the
blood of the Wynns, and that shall warm to thee yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This most unexampled wedding was followed in a few days by
another ceremony more befitting the social position of Lady
Devereaux, and at the same time Miss Meredith gave her hand to
the delighted Justice Powell.&nbsp; Somehow, it did not occur to
any of the parties that its brilliance was much impaired by the
absence of Miss Felina Tomtabby Price, and her high-minded
sister.&nbsp; These stately spinsters determined to punish their
family for this unprecedented proceeding, by withdrawing their
countenance from them, and the degenerate world for ever.</p>
<p>Some of the <i>great</i>, (great fools!) that is to say, the
most eminently useless residents of the then proud town of
Brecon, were in the most embarrassing state of dilemma on this
occasion.&nbsp; They entertained very serious doubts as to the
possibility of admitting our hero into their exquisitely select
circle, on account of his left-handed origin; and more than all,
his former questionable doings:&mdash;certain malignant spirits
having insinuated suspicions of his once figuring in London as a
black-leg, if not a thief.&nbsp; But as the patronizing influence
of Sir John Price was scanned, they condescended to overlook
these supposed peccadilloes; as it was decidedly proved to them
that he had never vulgarized himself by any practice of
usefulness in the world, by what they deemed worse than
witchcraft in the debasement of gentility&mdash;the following of
a trade or profession.</p>
<p>Our tale is almost ended; we have only to add a word or two
with respect to our principal characters, as it would hardly be
respectful to dismiss them without some appearance of
attention.</p>
<p>Reparation having been made to all parties who were sufferers
by our hero&rsquo;s faults and follies, the Graspacres, father
and son, by the good offices of Sir John Wynn and the friendly
Prothero, were in time conciliated.&nbsp; The luckless Inco Evans
had soon after <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>to add to his other losses, that of his clerical gown,
on account of a certain complaint preferred against him to his
diocesan, by Miss Bessy Gwevel-heer: and his magisterial function
was also numbered with the things that were, but are not.&nbsp;
When despised and impoverished, in his old age, Twm stepped
forward with timely aid, that more than compensated for the
injuries he had ever done him.</p>
<p>Twm showed most kindly consideration for hungry Moses and his
ever starving family, and made a praiseworthy attempt to fatten
them up.&nbsp; All was in vain, and Moses was struck with wonder
and admiration when he saw an unusually stout specimen of
humanity.</p>
<p>The venerable Ianto Gwyn was installed as the family harper;
while each and all of the humbler companions of his wild days,
were acknowledged, befriended, and aided in their views in
life.</p>
<p>The landlady of the Cat and Fiddle was so greatly benefited by
the association of our hero&rsquo;s name in her house, that her
increased wealth and charms gained her another husband, in the
person of little Tommy Thomas, the late under whipper-in of
Ystrad Feen; and their sign underwent a change to &ldquo;The Twm
Shon Catty Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, many years after all these things had been so happily
and comfortably settled, to the satisfaction of the principal
parties concerned, an old friend called upon Twm in the person of
Doctor John David Rhys, who had acquired great fame and honour in
far-off Continental cities.&nbsp; Their meeting was most joyous;
and when he reminded his old pupil of his prophecy respecting his
union with the lady of his dream, a friendly pressure of her hand
accompanied by an inexpressibly sweet smile, acknowledged her
pleasure in the truth of his foresight.</p>
<p>Poetical justice and fact, are unhappily at variance in our
closing notice of this most excellent character.&nbsp; During his
residence abroad, he changed his profession of a Protestant
Divine, and became a Catholic, and a <a name="page301"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 301</span>physician; practising among princes
and nobles, he soon realized an ample fortune.&nbsp; For the
enjoyment of a further intercourse with these, his friends, in
preference to his own native Anglesea, he fixed his residence at
Llanllwch, in the neighbourhood of Brecon.</p>
<p>Here our hero&rsquo;s friendship stood him much in stead; for
when the <i>enlightened</i> Protestant mobs of the time
persecuted him for his faith, forcibly entering his house to
search for the Pope in the cavity of his porridge pot, and a
legion of Friars in his night-chair and warming-pan, Squire Jones
was the magistrate that stood forward to check their
lawlessness.&nbsp; His great popularity and known Protestant
principles were all sufficient warrants for his word, when he
assured the many-headed monster of the groundlessness of such
suspicions.</p>
<p>Our hero, who, the reader must be aware, has shown no little
power in poesy, set to work to write the history of the Gwydir
family, when he discovered that his father was devoting himself
to the same purpose.&nbsp; The old man candidly declared that
among his ten sons, not one of them possessed a literary taste,
or evinced a congenial feeling with him in his pursuits.&nbsp;
But his left-handed eleventh seemed to justify the adage
respecting luck in odd numbers, which drew on him his affections
accordingly.</p>
<p>Squire Jones never forgot the humble way in which he spent the
earliest portion of his life; his was a nature as little likely
to be unduly elevated by prosperity as unnecessarily cast down by
adversity.</p>
<p>When he built a mansion at Tregaron, beside the cottages of
his childhood, he would never suffer the homely fabric to be
removed, but kept it as a private appendage to his house; the
interior containing all its rude characteristics, as left at his
mother&rsquo;s death, which took place a week before his union;
although poor Catty survived both her sister Juggy and her
husband.&nbsp; There, once a year he made a lonely visit of many
hours; and felt his heart soften as he surveyed the rude shelves
and wooden bowls and piggins; <a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>platters and trenchers; and even the
spoons and ladles manufactured by the coarse hand of his late
step-father.&nbsp; The unflattering reminiscences awakened by the
annual visits were better than sackcloth to the skin of kings, as
an antidote to worldly pride, and a check to the overweening
heartiness and want of sympathy with our humbler brethren in
their struggles for a little firmer feeling on the earth; which
is ever the result of the undisputed despotism of prosperity.</p>
<p>Thomas Jones, Esq., filled many most honourable offices in the
good town of Brecon, and in such a manner as to prove that
fortune for this once had not showed her favours upon one
unworthy of them.&nbsp; His early friend, Dr. John David Rhys,
mentions him with respect as an accomplished antiquary, and
testifies to the general excellence and worth of his
character.&nbsp; For many years he was Mayor and Sheriff of
Brecon, and we will close our chronicle of his various
achievements by one more anecdote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; cried the lady mayoress one day to her
husband, as they passed arm in arm through the street from
church, &ldquo;the people are always laughing to think of my
marrying you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo;
replied the hero of these adventures, &ldquo;for whenever I think
of it, I laugh myself.&rdquo;</p>

303</span>APPENDIX.</h1>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Triads referred to, as the
collection made by Thomas Jones, of Tregaron, (Twm Shon Catty,)
are translated from a series in the second volume of the Welsh
Arch&aelig;ology, p. 57.&nbsp; The series bear the following
title.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are Triads of the Island of
Britain&mdash;that is to say, Triads of memorial and record, and
the information of remarkable men or things which have been in
the Island of Britain; and of the events which befell the Race of
the Cymry, from the age of ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the copy, from which the transcript was made for the London
edition, the following note is annexed.</p>
<p>(Translation.) &ldquo;These Triads were taken from the book of
Caradoc of Nantcarvan, and from the book of Jevan Brechva, by me,
Thomas Jones, of Tregaron&mdash;and those are all I could get of
<i>the three hundred</i>&mdash;1601.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The three pillars of the Race of the Island of
Britain.</p>
<p>The first <i>Hu Gudarn</i>, who first brought the Race of the
Cymry into the Island of Britain; and they came from the land of
<i>Hav</i> called <i>Defrobani</i>, [where Constantinople
stands,] and they passed over Mor Tawch (the German ocean) to the
Island of Britain, and to Llydaw where they remained.</p>
<p>The second, <i>Prydain</i>, the son of <i>Aedd-Mawr</i>, who
first established regal government in the Island of
Britain.&nbsp; [Before this, there was no equity but what was
done by gentleness, nor any law but that of force.]</p>
<p>The third, <i>Dyfnwal Moelmud</i>, who first discriminated the
laws and ordinances, customs and privileges of the <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>land and
nation.&nbsp; [And for these reasons they were called the three
pillars of the nation of Cymry.]</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The three benevolent tribes of the Island of
Britain.</p>
<p>The first was the stock of the <i>Cymry</i>, who came with Hu
Gadarn, into the Island of Britain; for <i>He</i> would not have
lands by fighting and contention, but of equity, and in
peace.</p>
<p>The second was the race of the Lloegrwys, who came from the
land of Gwas-gwyn, and were sprung from the primitive stock of
the Cymry.</p>
<p>The third were the Britons.&nbsp; They came from the land of
Llydaw, and were also sprung from the primordial line of the
Cymry.</p>
<p>[And they are called the three peaceful tribes because they
came by mutual consent and permission, in peace and
tranquillity.&nbsp; The three tribes descended from the primitive
race of the Cymry, and the three were of one language and one
speech.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Three tribes came, under protection, into the
Island of Britain, and by the consent and permission of the
nation of Cymry, without weapon, without assault.</p>
<p>The first was the tribe of the Caledonians, in the North.</p>
<p>The second was the Gwyddelian Race, which are now in Alban
(Scotland.)</p>
<p>The third were the men of the Galedin, who came in their naked
ships (canoes) into the Isle of Wight, when their country was
drowned, and had lands assigned them by the Race of the
Cymry.</p>
<p>And they had neither privilege nor claim in the Island of
Britain, but the land and protection that they granted, under
specified limits.&nbsp; And it was decreed, that they should not
enjoy the immunities of the native Cymry, before the ninth
generation.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Three usurping tribes came into the Island of
Britain, and never departed out of it.</p>
<p><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>The
first was the <i>Coranied</i>, who came from the land of
Pwyl.</p>
<p>The second were the Gwyddelian Fichti, who came into Alban,
over the sea of <i>Llychlyn</i> (Denmark).</p>
<p>The third were the Saxons.</p>
<p>[The Corained are <i>about</i> the Humber, and on the shore of
Mor Tawch, and the Gwyddelian Finchti are in Alban, on the shore
of the sea of Llychlyn.&nbsp; The Coranied united with the
Saxons, and being partly incorporated with them, deprived the
Lloegrwys of their government, by wrong and oppression; and
afterwards, they deprived the Race of the Cymry of their crown
and sovereignty.&nbsp; All the Lloegrwys became Saxons, except
those who are found in Cornwall, and in the Commot of
<i>Carnobun</i>, in <i>Deria</i> and <i>Bernicia</i>.</p>
<p>The primitive Race of the Cymry have kept their land and their
language; but they lost their sovereignty of the Island of
Britain, through the treachery of the protected tribes, and the
violence of the three usurping tribes.]</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; The three awful events of the Island of Britain.</p>
<p>First, the bursting of the lake of waters, and the
overwhelming of the face of all lands; so that all mankind were
drowned excepting Dwyvan and Dwyvach, who escaped in a naked
vessel, (without sails), and of them the Island of Britain was
re-peopled.</p>
<p>The second was the consternation of the tempestuous fire, when
the earth split asunder, to Annwn, (lower region,) and the
greatest part of all living was consumed.</p>
<p>The third was the scorching summer, when the woods and plants
were set on fire, by the intense heat of the sun, and multitudes
of men and beasts, and all kinds of birds, and reptiles and trees
and plants irrecoverably lost.</p>
<p><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>VI.&nbsp; The three chief master works of the island of
Britain.</p>
<p>The ship of <i>Nevydd Nav Neivion</i>, who carried in it a
male and a female of all living, when the lake of waters burst
forth.</p>
<p>The drawing of the <i>avanc</i> to land out of the lake, by
the branching oxen of <i>Hu Gadarn</i>, so that the lake burst no
more;</p>
<p>And the stones of Gwyddon Ganhebon, on which were read the
arts and sciences of the world.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; The three great Regulators of the Island of
Britain.</p>
<p>Hu Gadarn, bringing the Race of the Cymry out of the land of
Hav, which is called Defrobahi into the Island of Britain.</p>
<p>Prydain, the son of Aedd-Mawr, establishing government and law
over the Island of Britain.</p>
<p>And Rhitta Gawr, who made himself a robe of the beards of
kings, whom he caused to be shaved (reduced to vassalage) for
their oppressions and contempt of justice.</p>
<p>VIII.&nbsp; The three happy controllers of the Island of
Britain.</p>
<p>Prydain, the son of Aedd-Mawr, suppressing the Dragon
tyranny.&nbsp; [This was a tyranny of pillage and contempt of
Equity, that sprung up in the Island.]</p>
<p>Caradog, the son of Bran, the son of Llyr, checking the
oppression of the C&aelig;sars;</p>
<p>And Rhitta Gawr, controlling the tyranny and pillage of the
tumultary kings.</p>
<p>IX.&nbsp; The three benefactors of the Race of Cymry.</p>
<p>The first, Hu Gadarn, who first showed the Race of the Cymry
the method of cultivating the ground, when they were in the land
of Hav [namely, where Constantinople now stands] before they came
into the Island of Britain.</p>
<p>Coll, the son of Coll-Frewi, who first brought wheat <a
name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>and barley
into the island of Britain, where, before, there had only been
oats and rye;</p>
<p>And Elldyd the knight, [a holy man of Cor Dewdws,] who
improved the manner of cultivating the ground, taught the Cymry a
better method than had been known before, and showed the art of
ploughing which now prevails.&nbsp; [For before the time of
Elldyd, land was cultivated only with a mattock and a spade,
after the manner of the Gyddelians.]</p>
<p>X.&nbsp; The three primary Sages of the Race of the Cymry.</p>
<p>Hu Gadarn, who first collected the Race of the Cymry, and
disposed them into tribes.</p>
<p>Dyvnwal-Molemud, who first regulated the laws, privileges, and
institutions of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>And Tydain tad Awen, who first introduced order and method
into the memorials and preservation of the Oral art (poetry) and
its properties.</p>
<p>And from that order, the privileges and methodical usages of
the Bards and Bardism (Druidism) of the Island of Britain, were
first devised.</p>
<p>XI.&nbsp; The three primary Bards of the Island of
Britain.</p>
<p>Plennydd, Alwan, and Gwron.</p>
<p>These were they who devised the privileges and usages which
belong to Bards and Bardism.</p>
<p>[Yet there had been Bards and Bardism before; but they were
not completely methodized, and they enjoyed neither privileges
nor established customs, but they were obtained through
gentleness and civility, and the protection of the country and
the nation, before the time of these three.</p>
<p>Some say they were in the time of Prydain, the son of Aedd
Mawr, others, that they were in the time of his son,
Dyvnwal-Molemud, whom some of the old books call Dyvnvarth, the
son of Prydain.</p>
<p><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>XII.&nbsp; The three elementary masters of Poetry and
Memorial, of the Race of the Cymry.</p>
<p>Gwyddon Ganhebon, the first man in the world who composed
poetry;</p>
<p>Hu Gadarn, who first adapted poetry to the preservation of
records and memorials;</p>
<p>And Tydain Tad Awen, who first developed the art and structure
of poetry, and the due disposition of thought.</p>
<p>And, from the labours of these three personages, sprang Bards
and Bardism, and the regulation of their privileges and
established discipline, by the three primary Bards, Plenvydd,
Alwan, and Gwron.</p>
<p>XIII.&nbsp; The three primary baptized (or christian)
Bards.</p>
<p>Merddyn Emrys; Taliesin, the chief of the Bards, and Merddin,
the son of Madawc Morvyn.</p>
<p>XIV.&nbsp; The three mighty Labours of the Isle of
Britain.</p>
<p>Erecting the stone of Ketti.&nbsp; Constructing the work of
Emrys.&nbsp; And heaping the pile of <i>Cyvrangon</i>.</p>
<p>The three happy astronomers.&nbsp; (<i>Serenyddion</i>,
<i>Suronides</i>) of the <i>Island</i> of <i>Britain</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Idris Gawr</i>.&nbsp; <i>Gwyddion</i> the son of the
<i>Don</i>.&nbsp; And <i>Gwyn</i> the son of <i>Nudd</i>.</p>
<p>So great was their knowledge of the stars, and of their nature
and situations, that they could foretell whatever might be
desired to be known to the day of doom.</p>
<p>XVI.&nbsp; The three masters of mysterious and secret science,
of the <i>Island</i> of <i>Britain</i>.</p>
<p><i>Math</i>, the son of <i>Mothanwy</i>, and he disclosed his
secret to <i>Gwyndion</i> the son of <i>Don</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mengw</i>, the son of <i>Teiagmaedd</i>, who taught his
secret to <i>Uthyr Bendragon</i>.</p>
<p>And <i>Rhuddlwm Gawr</i>, and he learned his mystery of
<i>Eddic Gor</i> and <i>Coll</i>, the son of <i>Coll
Frewi</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>XVII.&nbsp; The three great modellers of the
<i>Island</i> of <i>Britain</i>.</p>
<p><i>Corvinwr</i>, the Bard of <i>Ceri Hir</i> of
<i>Llyngwyn</i>, who first made a ship, with a sail and a helm,
for the race of the <i>Cymry</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mozdial Gwr Gweilgi</i>, the architect of <i>Ceraint</i>,
the son of <i>Greidial</i>, who first taught the race of the
<i>Cymry</i>, the work of stone and lime, [at the time
<i>Alexander the Great</i> was subduing the world.]</p>
<p>And <i>Coll</i>, the son of <i>Cylin</i>, [the son of
<i>Caradawr</i>, the son of <i>Bran</i>,] who first made a mill
with a wheel, for the race of <i>Cymry</i>.</p>

Maes-y-velin was Samuel, the son of Rhys Prichard, the celebrated
author of &ldquo;Canwyll y Cymry,&rdquo; (the Welshman&rsquo;s
candle,) a volume of religious poems, the most popular, and said
to have done the most good, of any that ever was printed in the
Welsh language.&nbsp; To this favourite son the pious author
addressed many of his poems, exhorting and directing him, by
name, to the most minute acts in his devotion.&nbsp; On hearing
of his murder, the old man is said to have burst out in the
wildest strain of prophetic phrenzy, with the following <span

trick (a similar one being related of the Friar of Gil Blas) is
attributed to Twm Shon Catty, his Editor can attest that this is
not the only incident of the kind that he would willingly have
related if he had dared.&nbsp; But as this, and others, have long
been on record, both in the memories of the country people, and
in the Welsh Jest Books, any omission of incident or anecdote on
the score of being property claimable by others, would be
scouted, as a poor-spirited compromise of their rights: it being
utterly out of the pale of possibility that the said good things
could have belonged originally, to any other than their own
redoubted Twm Shon Catty!&nbsp; This explanation, once for all,
must answer every similar objection on the part of the English
reader.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
